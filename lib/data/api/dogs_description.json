Some modern writers describe the Africanis as a pariah dog. This is considered an inappropriate classification, as the term typically denotes an ownerless, free-ranging dog. Considered a landrace with limited human interference in their breeding, the Africanis has also been maintained by human owners.The Africanis is a medium-sized, lightly built dog with a long slender muzzle and, usually, a short coat. It has been described as resembling a cross between a Greyhound and a Dingo. It can be found in almost any colour or combination of colours, although fawns, browns, brindles and blacks with various white markings are common. A distinctive, possibly primitive, feature is a black patch found high on the outside of the tail where the caudal gland is found in the wild wolf.The Africanis usually stands between 50 and 62 centimetres (20 and 24 in). Being a landrace, minor variations in appearance may be common. The Africanis is nonetheless known to breed true to a recognisable form.,Africa's indigenous dogs may be descended from ancient Egyptian dogs found throughout the Nile Delta around 5,900 years ago. It is believed the descendants of these dogs spread throughout Africa with tribal movements, first throughout the Sahara and finally reaching southern Africa around the 6th century AD.The Africanis has almost always been attached to human settlements in southern Africa. The dogs could have been used to help herd sheep, goats and cattle, guard against predators and help their human companions in the hunt. The Africanis has been known by a number of names. These include the Bantu dog, umbwa wa ki-shenzi (\"traditional dog\" in Kiswahili), the Hottentot hunting dog, the Khoekhoe dog, the Tswana dog and the Zulu dog. Other local names include Sica, Isiqha, Ixhalaga, Ixalagha, Isigola, I-Twina and Itiwina.While generally looked down upon by European settlers who preferred their imported dog breeds, the Africanis was held in higher esteem by Europeans in Africa than the Indian pye-dog was in India.In recent times efforts have been made to protect, preserve and promote these dogs, and prevent them from being split into a number of different breeds based upon different distinguishing physical features. In South Africa, a society has been established to preserve the Africanis, the Africanis Society of Southern Africa." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c3f7" }, "breed": "Airedale Terrier", "origin": "England", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airedale_Terrier", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Airedale_Terrier.jpg/220px-Airedale_Terrier.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c649" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/airedale_terrier.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 1, "grooming": 3, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 2, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 5, "trainability": 3, "energy": 3, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 11, "max_life_expectancy": 14, "max_height_male": 23, "max_height_female": 23, "max_weight_male": 70, "max_weight_female": 70, "min_height_male": 23, "min_height_female": 23, "min_weight_male": 50, "min_weight_female": 50, "breed": "Airedale Terrier" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5dda" }, "breed": "Airedale Terrier", "contenido": "The Airedale Terrier (often shortened to \"Airedale\"), also called Bingley Terrier and Waterside Terrier, is a dog breed of the terrier type that originated in the valley (dale) of the River Aire, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England.  It is traditionally called the \"King of Terriers\" because it is the largest of the terrier breeds.  The Airedale was bred from the Old English Black and Tan Terrier (now known as the Welsh Terrier), the Otterhound and probably some other Terrier breeds, and has contributed to other dog breeds, such as the Yorkshire Terrier. Originally bred to serve as a versatile hunting and all around working farm dog, this breed has also been used as a war dog, guide dog, and police dog in Britain. In the United States, the breed has been used to hunt big game, upland birds, and water fowl, and serve in many other working capacities.,The Airedale is the largest of the British terriers. They weigh 19\u201325 kilograms (42\u201355 lb) in fit condition and have a height at the withers of 58\u201361 centimetres (23\u201324 in) for males, with females slightly smaller. The American Kennel Club standard specifies a very slightly smaller dog. Larger Airedales, up to 55 kilograms (121 lb) can sometimes be found in North America.  They are sometimes referred to as \"Oorangs\" as this was the name of a kennel in Ohio in the early 1900s that produced this much larger variation, or Roosevelt Terriers.The Airedale has a medium-length black and tan coat with a harsh topcoat and a soft undercoat. They are an alert and energetic breed, \"not aggressive but fearless.\" It has been claimed that the larger \"Oorang\" type Airedales are more eager than the smaller, breed standard Airedales, but this is not necessarily so. The large type have been used for big game hunting and as family guardians or as pets, but usually do poorly in AKC (American Kennel Club) conformation shows. This larger type is also significantly more prone to hip dysplasia than the standard Airedales.,Like many terriers, the breed has a 'broken' coat, which is hard and wiry.  It is meant to be kept not so long as to appear ragged, and lies straight and close, covering body and legs. The outer coat is hard, wiry and stiff, the undercoat softer. The hardest coats are crinkly or just slightly waved. Curly soft coats are highly undesirable.,The coat is hypoallergenic, tending not to generate allergic reactions in people.,Airedales bearing undercoats are generally groomed by hand stripping where a small serrated edged knife is used to pull out loose hair from the dog's coat.  Most Airedales require frequent (6 to 8 weeks) clipping or stripping as they do not shed." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c3f9" }, "breed": "Akita", "origin": "Japan", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akita_(dog)", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/American-akita.jpg/220px-American-akita.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c64a" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/akita.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 1, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 3, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 2, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 5, "trainability": 3, "energy": 4, "barking": 2, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 14, "max_height_male": 28, "max_height_female": 28, "max_weight_male": 130, "max_weight_female": 100, "min_height_male": 26, "min_height_female": 26, "min_weight_male": 100, "min_weight_female": 70, "breed": "Akita" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ddc" }, "breed": "Akita", "contenido": "The Akita (\u79cb\u7530\u72ac, Akita-inu, Japanese pronunciation: [ak\u02b2ita.in\u026f]) is a historic dog breed of large size originating from the mountainous regions of northern Japan. The two separate varieties of Akita are a Japanese strain, commonly called Akita Inu (inu means dog in Japanese) or Japanese Akita, and an American strain, known as the Akita or American Akita. The Japanese strain occurs in a narrow palette of colors, with all other colors considered atypical of the breed, while the American strain comes in all dog colors. The Akita has a short double coat similar to that of many other northern spitz breeds such as the Siberian Husky, but long-coated dogs can also be found in many litters due to a recessive gene.,The Akita is a powerful, independent, and dominant breed, commonly aloof with strangers, but affectionate with family members. As a breed, Akitas are generally hardy.,In all countries except the United States, the Japanese and American strains of Akita are considered two separate breeds. In the United States, however, the two strains are considered a single breed with differences in type. For a while, the American strain of Akita was known in some countries as the Great Japanese Dog. Both forms of Akita are probably best known worldwide from the true story of Hachik\u014d, a loyal Akita that lived in Japan before World War II.,Debate exists among fanciers whether these are two separate breeds of Akitas. As of 2020, the American Kennel Club, now considers American and Japanese Akitas to be two separate breeds, no longer allowing free breeding between the two. The United Kennel Club, the Federation Cynologique Internationale, The Kennel Club, the Australian National Kennel Council, the New Zealand Kennel Club, and the Japan Kennel Club consider Japanese and American Akitas as separate breeds. Some countries refer to the American Akita as simply the Akita and not the American Akita. The issue is especially controversial in Japan. For the FCI's 84 countries, the breed split formally occurred June 1999, when the FCI decided that the American type would be called the Great Japanese Dog, later renamed the American Akita in January 2006.,The Akita Inu originated in the snowy and rural lands of Odate, Akita Prefecture, a wild and mountainous region of Japan. They were trained to hunt animals such as elk, wild boar, and Ussuri brown bears. This breed in the 1600s was involved in dog fighting, which at the time was popular in Japan. From the 1500s into the 1800s, the Akita served as companions for samurai.During the early 20th century, the Akita was in decline, as a result of being cross-bred with the German Shepherd Dog, St. Bernard, and Mastiff. As a result, many specimens started to lose their spitz characteristics and instead took on drop ears, straight tails, non-Japanese color (black masks, and any color other than red, white, or brindle), and loose skin. A native Japanese breed known as Matagi (hunting dog) was used along with the Hokkaido Inu breed to mix back into the remaining Akita Inu to bring back the spitz phenotype and restore the Akita breed. The modern-day Japanese Akita have relatively few genes from western dogs and are spitz in phenotype after the reconstruction of the breed took place, but the larger American breed of Akita largely descends from the mixed Akita before the restoration of the breed, thus American Akitas are typically mixed and not considered true Akitas by the Japanese standard.The Akita breed was used during the Russo-Japanese War to track prisoners of war and lost sailors. During World War II, the Akita was considered a non-military breed and was crossed with German Shepherds in an attempt to save them from the wartime government order for all non-military dogs to be culled.  Some were used as scouts and guards during the war. The ancestors of the American Akita were originally a variety of the Japanese Akita, a form that was not desired in Japan due to the markings, and which is not eligible for show competition.The story of Hachik\u014d, the most revered Akita of all time, helped push the Akita into the international dog world. Hachik\u014d was born in 1923 and owned by Professor Hidesabur\u014d Ueno of Tokyo. Professor Ueno lived near the Shibuya Train Station in a suburb of the city, and commuted to work every day on the train. Hachik\u014d accompanied his master to and from the station each day. On May 25, 1925, when the dog was 18 months old, he waited for his master's arrival on the four o'clock train, but Professor Ueno had suffered a fatal brain haemorrhage at work. Hachik\u014d continued to wait for his master's return. He travelled to and from the station each day for the next nine years. He allowed the professor's relatives to care for him, but he never gave up the vigil at the station for his master. His vigil became world-renowned when, in 1934, shortly before his death, a bronze statue was erected at the Shibuya train station in his honor. This statue was melted down for munitions during the war, but a new one was commissioned after the war. Each year on April 8 since 1936, Hachik\u014d's devotion has been honoured with a solemn ceremony of remembrance at Tokyo's Shibuya railroad station. Eventually, Hachik\u014d's legendary faithfulness became a national symbol of loyalty, particularly to the person and institution of the Emperor.In 1931, the Akita has officially declared a Japanese natural monument. The mayor of Odate City in Akita Prefecture organized the Akita Inu Hozonkai to preserve the original Akita as a Japanese natural treasure through careful breeding. In 1934, the first Japanese breed standard for the Akita Inu was listed, following the breed's declaration as a natural monument of Japan. In 1967, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Akita Dog Preservation Society, the Akita Dog Museum was built to house information, documents and photos. There is a tradition in Japan, that when a child is born they receive a statue of an Akita. This statue symbolizes health, happiness, and a long life." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c3fc" }, "breed": "Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog", "origin": "United States", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alapaha_Blue_Blood_Bulldog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Alapaha_Blue-Blood_Bulldog.jpg/220px-Alapaha_Blue-Blood_Bulldog.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ddf" }, "breed": "Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog", "contenido": "The Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog is a breed of bulldog from the United States, and it is predominantly used as a guard dog.

They are similar to other arctic, husky, and spitz breeds such as the Greenland Dog, Canadian Eskimo Dog, the Siberian Husky, and the Samoyed.,Although it is believed that the first dogs arrived in the Americas 12,000 years ago, people and their dogs did not settle in the Arctic until the Paleo-Eskimo people 4,500 years ago, followed by the Thule people 1,000 years ago, with both originating from Siberia. Malamutes were thought to be bred by the Malemiut Inupiaq people of Alaska's Norton Sound region.The Malamute has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century. A study in 2013 showed that the Alaskan Malamute has a similar east Asian origin to, but is not clearly related to, the Greenland Dog and the Canadian Eskimo Dog, but contains a possible admixture of the Siberian Husky.In 2015, a study using several genetic markers indicated that the Malamute, the Siberian Husky, and the Alaskan husky share a close genetic relationship between each other and were related to Chukotka sled dogs from Siberia. They were separate from the two Inuit dogs, the Canadian Eskimo Dog and the Greenland Dog. In North America, the Malamute and the Siberian Husky both had maintained their Siberian lineage and had contributed significantly to the Alaskan husky, which showed evidence of crossing with European breeds that was consistent with this breed being created in post-colonial North America. DNA extracted from a 9,500-year-old dog, Zhokhov, named after the Siberian island, was found to have shared a common ancestor with the Greenland sledge dog, the Alaskan Malamute and the Siberian Husky.,The American Kennel Club (AKC) breed standard describes a natural range of size, with a desired size of 23 inches (58 cm) tall and 75 pounds (34 kg) for females, 25 inches (64 cm) tall and 85 pounds (39 kg) for males. Heavier individuals (90 lb (41 kg)) and dogs smaller than 75 pounds (34 kg) are commonly seen. There is often a marked size difference between males and females. Weights upwards of 100 pounds (45 kg) are also seen.The coat of the Alaskan Malamute is a double coat. The undercoat has an oily and woolly texture and can be as thick as two inches. The outer guard coat is coarse and stands off the body longer at the withers but not more than one inch off the sides of the body. Ears are small in proportion to the head and stand firmly erect when at attention. The Alaskan Malamute is a heavy dog, with a more formidable nature and structure than the Siberian Husky, which is bred for speed. The Alaskan Malamute is bred for power and endurance, which is its original function and what the standard of the breed requires of Alaskan Malamute breeders.,The usual colors are various shades of gray and white, sable and white, black and white, seal and white, red and white, or solid white. There are a wide range of markings in the breed including face markings, blazes, a splash at the nape of the neck, and a collar or half collar. White is often the predominant color on the body, parts of the legs, feet, and part of the markings of the face. In terms of color variants, some Malamutes exhibit a dark grey to buff-colored undertone around their trimmings and white areas, presenting with a color-linked gene known as Agouti. Two agouti alleles, with the possibility of a third, appear to be found in Malamutes: aw (Agouti Pattern or Wolf/Wild Pattern), at (Tan Point Pattern or Black Pattern), and awat (Heterozygous Agouti or Dark Agouti).,The eyes of the Alaskan Malamute are almond-shaped and are varied shades of brown; however, the darker eye is preferred. Purebred Alaskan Malamutes will not have blue eyes. The physical build of the Malamute is compact and strong with substance, bone and snowshoe feet.,According to the AKC breed standard, the Malamute's tail is well furred and is carried over the back like a waving plume. Corkscrew tails are occasionally seen but are faulted in the AKC breed standard (a corkscrew tail is commonly seen in the Akita). The Malamutes well-furred tails aid in keeping them warm when they curl up in the snow. They are often seen wrapping the tail around their nose and face, which presumably helps protect them against harsh weather such as blowing snow. Their ears are generally upright, wedge-shaped, small in proportion to the head and set to the side of the skull. The muzzle is deep and broad, tapering slightly from the skull to the nose. Nose and gums are black but some Malamutes have a snow nose, which is black with a pink undertone that can get darker or lighter, depending on the season." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c400" }, "breed": "Alpine Dachsbracke", "origin": "Austria", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_Dachsbracke", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Alpejski_go%C5%84czy_kr%C3%B3tkono%C5%BCny_g99.jpg/220px-Alpejski_go%C5%84czy_kr%C3%B3tkono%C5%BCny_g99.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5de5" }, "breed": "Alpine Dachsbracke", "contenido": "The Alpine Dachsbracke (ger.

Neither The Kennel Club nor American Kennel Club (AKC) have recognized or accepted the American Bully into their registry as a purebred dog. The founding registry (ABKC) divided the American Bully into four categories, including the Pocket, Standard, Classic, and XL, whereas other registries, including the UKC, have approved one consistent size standard.,The American Bully, as it is now known, began development in the 1980s with the majority of the final behavioral and aesthetic product being completed in the 1990s. There is consensus that at least five other breeds were used to attain the more \"bully\" physical traits desired as well as the more diminutive size of some lines. The American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT) was the foundation (parent breed) used to create the American Bully. The APBT has maintained a characteristic appearance and temperament for over a century. Within that span of time different strains of APBT emerged within the breed, each with different physical attributes. One particular APBT strain developed a specific, stockier, physique that warranted recognition as a different breed altogether. The bloodline of this APBT strain was then influenced with the introduction of American Bulldog, English Bulldog, and Olde English Bulldogge in order to fine-tune desired physical characteristics and personality traits.The breed was first recognized by its breed club, the American Bully Kennel Club (ABKC), in 2004. This registry first acted as a means to document pedigrees and show the breed against its written standard. According to the ABKC the initial desire for this breed was to produce a dog with a lower prey drive and more of the \"bully\" traits and characteristics than the American Staffordshire Terrier. Mass and heavy bone was prioritized to ensure such a look, and due to this many of the dogs shown today display the wide front for which they were originally bred.The breed's development and popularity are commonly tied to the growth of hip-hop culture. The American Bully should not be confused with the several other bulldog-type breeds.,Within the ABKC, the four varieties are separated by height without specification of weight. All these varieties are expected to follow the same standard with minor alterations.All dogs are classified and shown as Standard until they reach a year of age, at which point they are separated into the varieties and shown against their own type.,The standard American Bully type is a medium-sized dog with a compact bulky muscular body, heavy bone structure and blocky head. Male dogs must be 17 to 20 in (43 to 51 cm), while females must be 16 to 19 in (41 to 48 cm)." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c404" }, "breed": "American Hairless Terrier", "origin": "United States", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Hairless_Terrier", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Aht-sable%26white3.jpg/220px-Aht-sable%26white3.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c650" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/american_hairless_terrier.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 1, "grooming": 1, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 5, "energy": 3, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 14, "max_life_expectancy": 16, "max_height_male": 16, "max_height_female": 16, "max_weight_male": 16, "max_weight_female": 16, "min_height_male": 12, "min_height_female": 12, "min_weight_male": 12, "min_weight_female": 12, "breed": "American Hairless Terrier" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ded" }, "breed": "American Hairless Terrier", "contenido": "The American Hairless Terrier is a breed of companion dog from the United States that was developed from naturally hairless Rat Terriers.,In 1972 a completely hairless bitch pup was whelped in a litter of purebred Rat Terriers owned by Willie and Edwin Scott of Louisiana.

In 1983 the dog, Snoopy, was mated to his hairless sisters and many more hairless pups were whelped, establishing the foundation stock for the new breed. Originally registered as a hairless variety of Rat Terriers, eventually the Scotts adopted a different breed name for their unique line and established a separate breed club, the American Hairless Terrier Association.

The breed has pricked ears and can be born with either a naturally short tail or a long tail that is never docked.At birth American Hairless Terriers are born with a light fuzz of hair over their entire body which they gradually shed from the nose backwards until they are entirely naked, this typically occurs by the age of six weeks; they retain eyebrows and whiskers. The breed standard states hairless examples\u2019 skin can be any color, although they are usually part colored with freckles that enlarge with age. Because of their lack of hair, the breed is particularly susceptible to hypothermia in cold weather as well as sunburn in sunning conditions.Some American Hairless Terriers are whelped with coats, they are still recognised as examples of the breed. The breed standard states coated examples of the breed have a short and dense coat that can be solid white, bi-color, tri-color, sable or brindle, always with some white.,Feist" }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c405" }, "breed": "Pitbull", "origin": "United States", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitbull", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Pit_bull_sampler.jpg/220px-Pit_bull_sampler.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f5c" }, "breed": "Pitbull", "contenido": "Pit bull is a term used in the United States for a type of dog descended from bulldogs and terriers, while in other countries such as the United Kingdom the term is used as an abbreviation of the American Pit Bull Terrier breed. The term was first used in 1927. Within the United States the pit bull is usually considered a heterogeneous grouping that includes the breeds American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, American Bully, Staffordshire Bull Terrier and occasionally the American Bulldog, along with any crossbred dog that shares certain physical characteristics with these breeds. In other countries including Britain, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier is not considered a pit bull. Most pit bull-type dogs descend from the British Bull and terrier, a 19th-century dog-fighting type developed from crosses between the Old English Bulldog and the Old English Terrier.Pit bull-type dogs have a controversial reputation as pets both in the United States and internationally, due to their history in dog fighting, the number of high-profile attacks documented in the media over decades, and their proclivity to latching on while biting. Proponents of the breed and advocates of regulation have engaged in a nature-versus-nurture debate over whether apparent aggressive tendencies in pit bulls may be appropriately attributed to owners' care for the dog or inherent qualities. Numerous advocacy organizations have sprung up in defense of the pit bull. Some studies have argued that the type is not disproportionately dangerous, offering competing interpretations on dog bite statistics. Independent organizations have published statistics based on hospital records showing pit bulls are responsible for more than half of dog bite incidents among all breeds despite comprising 6% of pet dogs.:\u200aloc 690\u200a Some insurance companies will not cover pit bulls (along with rottweilers and wolf hybrids) because these particular breeds cause a disproportionate rate of bite incidents. Dog bite severity varies by the breed of dog, and studies have found that pit bull-type dogs have both the highest risk of biting and a tendency to produce the most severe injuries.Pit bull-type dogs are extensively used in the United States for dogfighting, a practice that has continued despite being outlawed. A number of nations and jurisdictions restrict the ownership of pit bull-type dogs through breed-specific legislation. A pro-pit bull lobby exists that spends millions of dollars a year promoting pit bulls as family pets, funding pro-pit bull researchers, and opposing laws that regulate their ownership.:\u200aloc 762\u200a,It is believed all dogs that are now classified as pit bulls descend from the British bull and terrier, which were first imported into North America in the 1870s. The bull-and-terrier was a breed of dog developed in the United Kingdom in the early 19th century for the blood sports of dog fighting and rat baiting, it was created by crossing the ferocious, thickly muscled Old English Bulldog with the agile, lithe, feisty Black and Tan Terrier. The aggressive Old English Bulldog, which was bred for bear and bull baiting, was often also pitted against its own kind in organised dog fights, but it was found that lighter, faster dogs were better suited to dogfighting than the heavier Bulldog. To produce a lighter, faster more agile dog that retained the courage and tenacity of the Bulldog, outcrosses from local terriers were tried, and ultimately found to be successful.As it was in the United Kingdom, dog fighting became a popular pastime in 19th century America and bull-and-terriers were imported to the New World to pursue the blood sport. In the United States organised dog fights have been progressively outlawed in various states since 1874, culminating in federal legislation criminalising animal fighting in 2007.In the 1890s breeders of American pit bull-type dogs attempted to have their dogs recognised by the American Kennel Club, but because of the type's association with dogfighting, the club rejected these entreaties. Following this rejection, in 1898 breeders of American Pit Bull Terriers established a rival kennel club, the United Kennel Club. In addition to being a breed registry, the United Kennel Club also regulated dogfights. In the 1930s the American Kennel Club was faced with a dilemma, whilst not wishing to condone dogfighting there was a desire to recognise a uniquely American dog breed for which over 30 years of breed records existed. The solution was to recognise Pit Bull Terriers under a different name and prohibit these dogs from being used in organised fights and in 1935 the American Kennel Club recognised Pit Bull Terriers as Staffordshire Terriers.The name \"Staffordshire Bull Terrier\" was first used in Britain in 1930 in advertisements for bull-and-terrier-type dogs. Organised dog fighting had been effectively eliminated in the United Kingdom by the Protection of Animals Act 1911, but devotees of the bull-and-terrier type continued to breed these dogs, predominantly in England's Black Country. Throughout the early 1930s attempts were made in England to gain recognition for these dogs with The Kennel Club, these efforts were successful in 1935. In order to avoid confusion with the British breed, in 1972 the American Kennel Club changed the name of their American breed to the American Staffordshire Terrier.Despite criminalisation, illegal fights using pit bull-type dogs have continued to be widespread in the United States, in the 1990s in that country it was estimated 1,500 dogs died annually in organised fights and by the mid-2000s it was estimated over 40,000 people were involved in the illegal blood sport. Pit bull-type dogs are also used by criminal organisations to guard illegal narcotics, and to intimidate and attack civilians, other criminals and police, the type becoming a status symbol in American gang culture. On the other side of the law, pit bull-type dogs have been used by U.S. Customs and Border Protection as drug detection dogs.There is a lobby of animal rights groups that are spending millions of dollars to try to \"re-brand pit bulls as family dogs.\" In efforts to counter negative perceptions about pit bull-type dogs, both the San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the New York City Center for Animal Care and Control have unsuccessfully attempted to rename the type.,Studies have found that when people involved in dog rescue, adoption, and regulation identify the breed of a dog of mixed parentage, this identification did not always correlate with the DNA analysis of that dog. Mixed-breed dogs are often labeled as pit bulls if they have certain physical characteristics, such as a square-shaped head or bulky body type.,A 2000 joint review project between researchers in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) and American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) found the data indicated that Rottweilers and pit bull-type dogs accounted for 67% of human dog bite-related fatalities in the United States between 1997 and 1998, and followed with \"It is extremely unlikely that they accounted for anywhere near 60% of dogs in the United States during that same period and, thus, there appears to be a breed-specific problem with fatalities.\" Pit bull-type dogs were identified in approximately one-third of dog bite-related fatalities in the United States between 1981 and 1992. The review notes that studies on dog bite-related fatalities which collect information by surveying news reports are subject to potential errors, as some fatal attacks may not have been reported, a study might not find all relevant news reports, and the dog breed might be misidentified.In a 2021 review of 19 retrospective dog bite studies from U.S. Level I trauma centers, pit bulls were found to inflict a higher prevalence and severity of injuries compared with other breeds. A 2020 literature review in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery found that from 1971 to 2018 of all pure breed dogs in the United States, pit bull-type breeds were second, behind the German Shepherd, and ahead of Labradors, Chow Chows, and Rottweilers (in that order) for the most bites severe enough to require hospital treatment. The study found that the proportion of bites caused by German Shepherds decreased by 0.63 percent per year over that time interval while the proportion caused by pit bulls increased by 1.17 percent per year. The pit bull proportion of dog bites increased more slowly in Denver, Colorado, where breed-specific legislation had been in place.In a 2014 literature review of dog bite studies, the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) argues that breed is a poor sole predictor of dog bites. Some controlled studies have not identified pit bulls as disproportionately dangerous, while others have found that compared with other dog breeds they are far more likely to attack unprovoked and often go off property to do so. Pit bull-type dogs are more frequently identified with cases involving very severe injuries or fatalities than other breeds, but a 2007 study suggested this may relate to the popularity of the breed, noting that sled dogs, such as Siberian Huskies, were involved in a majority of fatal dog attacks in some areas of Canada. Bite statistics by breed are no longer tracked by the CDC, and are discouraged by the AVMA and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA).Pit bulls were originally bred for bull baiting and dog fighting, and because of this heritage, they often show a tendency to attack other animals with a remarkable ferocity that contributes to public stigma against the breed. In fighting with dogs of other breeds, pit bulls, German Shepherds, Great Danes and Rottweilers were often the aggressor, and more than twenty percent of studied Akitas, Jack Russell Terriers and pit bulls displayed serious aggression towards other dogs. Although there may be a connection between breed of dog and aggression towards humans, the difficulty of classifying dog attacks by specific breed after the fact has made this point controversial and debated. Violent interactions between humans and canines have been studied by the U.S. government, notably the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as academic veterinary researchers. The interpretation of these studies, breed identification and relevance issues, and variable circumstances have given rise to intense controversy. Additionally, researchers on both sides of the pit bull debate rarely disclose when they are being funded by lobbyists, leading to a risk that the scientific literature on pit bulls has been influenced by money.:\u200ap. 1172\u200aPit bulls are known for their tenacity and refusal to release a bite, even in the face of great pain. A popular myth mischaracterized pit bulls as having \"locking jaws.\" The refusal to let go is a behavioral, not physiological trait, and there is no locking mechanism in a pit bull's jaws. Pit bull-type dogs, like other terriers, hunting and bull-baiting breeds, can exhibit a bite, hold, and shake behavior and at times refuse to release. Pit bulls also have wide skulls, well-developed facial muscles, and strong jaws, and some research suggests that pit bull bites are particularly serious because they tend to bite deeply and grind their molars into tissue. Breaking an ammonia ampule and holding it up to the dog's nose can cause the dog to release its hold." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c406" }, "breed": "American Staffordshire Terrier", "origin": "United States", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Staffordshire_Terrier", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/AMERICAN_STAFFORDSHIRE_TERRIER%2C_Zican%E2%80%99s_Bz_Ez_Dragon_%2824208348891%29.2.jpg/220px-AMERICAN_STAFFORDSHIRE_TERRIER%2C_Zican%E2%80%99s_Bz_Ez_Dragon_%2824208348891%29.2.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c651" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/american_staffordshire_terrier.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 2, "grooming": 1, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 4, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 5, "trainability": 3, "energy": 3, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 16, "max_height_male": 19, "max_height_female": 19, "max_weight_male": 70, "max_weight_female": 55, "min_height_male": 18, "min_height_female": 18, "min_weight_male": 55, "min_weight_female": 40, "breed": "American Staffordshire Terrier" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5def" }, "breed": "American Staffordshire Terrier", "contenido": "The American Staffordshire Terrier, also known as the AmStaff or American Staffy is a medium-sized, short-coated American dog breed.The height of an American Staffordshire Bull Terrier is 17\u201319 in (43\u201348 cm) tall and weighs between 40\u201370 lb (18\u201332 kg). The American Kennel Club (AKC) describes the breed as \"confident, smart and good-natured\". American Staffordshire Terriers are similar to American Pit Bull Terriers, though the American Pit Bull Terrier is not recognized by the American Kennel Club. The breed was accepted by the AKC in 1936. It should not be confused with the Staffordshire Bull Terrier of the United Kingdom.,Some varieties of Bull-and-terrier from the British Isles began to find their way into America as early as 1850. Some dogs became very famous for their dog fighting skills. Already developed as an American dog, such dogs became a new breed, which was recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) in February 1898 as the American Pit Bull Terrier. On June 10, 1936, about 50 UKC registered Pit Bull Terrier dogs were accepted for registration in the American Kennel Club (AKC) stud book with a new breed name and a new purpose, belonging to the AKC terrier group. The name Staffordshire Terrier was chosen, with the claim that the ancestors of the breed originally came from Staffordshire, England. The name of the breed was revised on January 1, 1969, to American Staffordshire Terrier to distinguish it from the British Staffordshire Bull Terrier, a separate breed from the Bull-type terrier group, recognized in England in 1935.The AKC opened the AmStaff Stud Book to UKC dogs a few more times until the 1970s. Since then, only dogs with AKC registration were to be bred together, if the offspring was to be registered. This fact, along with the breed selection based entirely on conformation through decades, has transformed the American Staffordshire Terrier into a different breed, separated from the American Pit Bull Terrier.The breed's popularity began to decline in the United States following World War II. In 2018, the American Kennel Club ranked the American Staffordshire Terrier as the 85th most popular purebred breed in the United States.,According to the American Kennel Club, these dogs are \"smart, confident, good-natured companions. Their courage is proverbial. A responsibly bred, well-socialized AmStaff is a loyal, trustworthy friend to the end.\",According to AKC's published breed standard which was approved June 10, 1936, the \"American Staffordshire Terrier should give the impression of great strength for his size, a well put-together dog, muscular, but agile and graceful, keenly alive to his surroundings. He should be stocky, not long-legged or racy in outline. His courage is proverbial.\" His head should be medium in length with a broad skull, a distinct stop, and pronounced muscles in the cheek.  The ears should be set high on their head and can be cropped or uncropped, but the latter is preferred. Height and weight should be in proportion. A height of about 18 to 19 inches (46 to 48 cm) at shoulders for the male and 17 to 18 inches (43 to 46 cm) for the female is to be considered preferable. The nose should always be black.

It was developed in the state of Wisconsin during the 19th century from a number of other breeds, including the Irish and English Water Spaniels. The breed was saved by Dr. Fred J. Pfeifer, who set up the breed club and standard, and whose work led to recognition for the breed by the United Kennel Club, and later, the American Kennel Club. While they are the state dog of Wisconsin, they remain a rare breed.,They are medium-sized dogs, and have a double layered coat, which comes in a variety of brown related shades. A versatile hunting dog, they are also suitable for apartment life due to work by breeders to develop a breed with an even temperament. The AWS may have been involved in the development of the Boykin Spaniel.,Originating in Wisconsin, the American Water Spaniel is the Wisconsin state dog. The breed originated in the areas along the Fox River and its tributary the Wolf River during the early 19th century. Hunters needed a dog that could work on both land and water, a versatile hunter skilled at bringing in a variety of game. Hunters also wanted a hunting dog compact enough to be transported in a small skiff, one that was able to withstand Wisconsin's cold water temperatures. Breeds involved in the creation of the American Water Spaniel are thought to have included the English Water Spaniel, Irish Water Spaniel, Curly Coated Retriever, native Indian Dogs, the Poodle, and either the Sussex Spaniel or another type of field spaniel.This little brown dog created was known at the time as the American Brown Spaniel, and weighed around 40 pounds (18 kg). It had a thick curly coat that protected it from the cold temperatures of the water and winter. It was used to hunt waterfowl, ruffed grouse, greater prairie chicken and a variety of fur\u2013bearing animals.,Over the years the numbers of the breed began to dwindle due both to a reduction in the duck population through those valley areas, and because of a switch in hunting \u2013 from a means to gather food for survival to that of recreation. Additionally, following World War II, new types of dogs became available in Wisconsin such as setters, pointers and other spaniels, allowing additional specialization in hunting.Dr. Fred J. Pfeifer, from New London, Wisconsin, set up Wolf River Kennels in order to save the breed. Numbers held by the kennel fluctuated but at times went up to 132 dogs. He advertised the dogs widely across the country, selling male dogs for $25 and females dogs for $20. Part of a sales pitch that Pfeifer mailed to prospective dog owners read, \"The American Brown Spaniel is distinctively an American production. Hunters have known this type for years and it was through their efforts that this dog was propagated.... For years we have bred only selective stock, breeding for gameness, stability, courage, intelligence, and beauty. They are dogs to admire and trust under all conditions whether in the home circle or in the field with the outdoor man.\"Due to Pfeifer's work, the breed was recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) as the American Water Spaniel in 1920, and by the Field Dog Stud Book in 1938. Dr. Pfeifer's own dog, named \"Curly Pfeifer\" was the first American Water Spaniel to be registered with UKC. John Scofield of Missouri and Thomas Brogdan of Rush Lake, Wisconsin worked together with the American Water Spaniel Club (AWSC), gaining the breed recognition with the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1940. Prior to recognition by the AKC, the breed had not been shown in the show ring before.The breed has links to the Boykin Spaniel, and is thought to have been the main breed used to develop the Boykin. The differences between the Boykin and the AWS are negligible with some dog historians suggesting that the original Boykin, called \"Dumpy\", who was found on the streets of Spartanburg, South Carolina, was actually an American Water Spaniel who had been misplaced in transit. However the breed clubs for the Boykin do not agree with this account.The breed was made the state dog of Wisconsin in 1985. The American Water Spaniel remains a rare breed. During 1998 only 233 puppies were registered with the AKC, with an estimated 3,000 dogs in existence mostly around the Midwestern United States, in particular in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan. In 2010, the breed was ranked 143rd most popular breed in the United States, out of 167 breeds. This is a decrease since 2000, when the breed was ranked 125th. The dogs are not classified specifically as either retrievers or as spaniels and so may not compete in AKC field trials, but may compete in AKC hunt tests (spaniel and retriever tests) and retriever hunting tests sponsored by the AWSC, the breed club in the United States. The American Water Spaniel Field Association was set up in 1993 by breed enthusiasts supporting AKC Spaniel classification and looking to provide field training opportunities to owners of the breed. In a vote held of members of the AWSC in 1999, they chose to keep the breed unclassified.,The limited popularity of the American Water Spaniel restricted development, resulting in the breed being relatively unchanged since its origins in the 19th century. They are a medium-sized dog, with a curly liver, brown, or chocolate colored coat. The average height at the withers for the breed is 15\u201318 inches (38\u201346 cm), and their weight around 25\u201345 pounds (11\u201320 kg). They have similar features to the Irish Water Spaniel, but the Irish breed is larger at between 21\u201324 inches (53\u201361 cm) and weighing 55\u201365 pounds (25\u201329 kg). The coat of the American Water Spaniel can fall in two different patterns, either tightly curled or in the \"marcel pattern\" where the fur falls in waves. Working and show lines have not diverged as with some other breeds of spaniel, and both appear the same, with show dogs of this breed being rare.The coat has a coarse outside layer which keeps water away and protects the dog from foliage such as briers. The inside layer provides insulation to keep the dog warm. The coat has an oily feel to it, which gives off a \"doggy smell\". The breed standard specifies color of the eyes should harmonize with the color of the coat, and should never be yellow. The skull is broad, and carries long, wide ears. The tail is not typically docked." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c409" }, "breed": "Anglo-Fran\u00e7ais de Petite V\u00e9nerie", "origin": "France", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Fran%C3%A7ais_de_Petite_V%C3%A9nerie", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Anglo-Fran%C3%A7ais_de_petite_v%C3%A9nerie.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5df3" }, "breed": "Anglo-Fran\u00e7ais de Petite V\u00e9nerie", "contenido": "The Andalusian Hound (Spanish: Podenco andaluz) is a warren hound dog breed originating in Spain, especially Andalusia.

Phillipe Bloque-Rent\u00f3n and colleagues at the University of C\u00f3rdoba's veterinary medicine faculty undertook the research work required to specify the breed; their study, presented at the second Simposium de las razas caninas espa\u00f1olas (Spanish dog breeds symposium) in 1992, was recognized by Real Sociedad Canina de Espa\u00f1a (Royal Spanish Dog Society, RSCE) in April of that year as a defining breed standard.

The Basset is a scent hound that was originally bred for the purpose of hunting hare. Their sense of smell and ability to ground-scent is second only to the Bloodhound.Basset Hounds are one of six recognized \"basset\"-type breeds in France. The name Basset is derived from the French word bas, meaning 'low', with the attenuating suffix -et\u2014together meaning 'rather low'. Basset Hounds are usually bicolours or tricolours of standard hound coloration.,Bassets are large, short, solid and long, with curved sabre tails held high over their long backs. An adult dog weighs between 20 and 35 kilograms (44 and 77 lb). This breed, relative to its size, is heavier-boned than any other.This breed, like its ancestor the Bloodhound, has a hanging skin structure, which causes the face to tend to have a sad look; this, for many people, adds to the breed's charm. The dewlap, seen as the loose, elastic skin around the neck, and the trailing ears which along with the Bloodhound are the longest of any breed, help trap the scent of what they are tracking. Its neck is wider than its head. This, combined with the loose skin around its face and neck means that flat collars can easily be pulled off. The previous FCI standard described the characteristic skin of the Basset, which resembles its ancestor the Bloodhound as \"loose\". This wording has since been updated to \"supple and elastic\". The looseness of the skin results in the Basset's characteristic facial wrinkles. They drool a lot due to their loose flews.,The Basset's skull is characterised by its large long nose, which is second only to the Bloodhound in scenting ability and number of olfactory receptor cells.,The Basset's short legs are due to a form of dwarfism (see: Health). Their short stature can be deceiving; Bassets are surprisingly long and can reach things on table tops that other dogs of similar heights cannot. Because Bassets are so heavy and have such short legs, they are not able to hold themselves above water for very long when swimming, and should always be closely supervised in the water.,The short-haired coat of a Basset is smooth and soft, and sheds constantly. Any hound coloration is acceptable, but this varies from country to country. They are usually black, tan and white tricolors or tan and white bicolors. Tan can vary from reddish-brown and red to lemon. Lemon and white is a less common color. Some Bassets are also classified as gray or blue - this color is considered rare and undesirable in the show ring.,The source of color is the E Locus (MC1R), which has four alleles: EM, EG, E, and e. The EM, E and e alleles are present in the Basset Hounds. The E allele allows for the production of both red and black pigments, so is present with the majority of color patterns in Basset Hounds." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c424" }, "breed": "Bergamasco Shepherd", "origin": "Italy", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergamasco_Shepherd", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Ortensia_di_Valle_Scrivia.jpg/220px-Ortensia_di_Valle_Scrivia.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e14" }, "breed": "Bergamasco Shepherd", "contenido": "The Bergamasco Shepherd, Italian: Cane da Pastore Bergamasco, is an Italian breed of sheepdog.

A genetic study in 2018 found evidence of haplotypes shared with other European breeds including the Berger Picard, the Bernese Mountain Dog and the Briard.A dog of this type was exhibited at the first Italian dog show in Milan in 1881. The first registration of the breed in the Libro Origini Italiano, the Italian national stud-book, was in 1891. A breed association, now called the Associazione Amatori del Cane da Pastore Bergamasco, was established in 1949.

Since 2019, the Bohemian Shepherd has been provisionally recognized by the FCI.,The Bohemian shepherd is a herding dog and guard dog, indigenous to the Chod region (around Doma\u017elice) of southwest Bohemia. During the reign of King Premysl Ottokar II (1253-1278), the Kingdom of Bohemia recruited the ancestors of the Chodov\u00e9 from ethnic enclaves within the western Carpathian Mountain region near the borders of what is today Slovakia, Poland, and southwestern Ukraine. These communities were relocated to serve as guards along the borders between Bohemia and Bavaria. While it is not known if the Bohemian shepherd accompanied the Chodove in their relocation or if the breed was developed soon afterwards, by 1325, the King of Bohemia, John of Luxembourg, acknowledged as a condition of their relocation and border protection, the ancestral Chodov\u00e9 were granted significant privileges that differentiated them from other subjects, including the right to own large dogs forbidden to ordinary Bohemian peasantry.The Bohemian shepherd would continue to be associated with the Chodov\u00e9 even after their agreement with the Kingdom of Bohemia was declared void in 1695.  J.A. Gabriel, writing about Chodov\u00e9 in 1864, described the local people as \u201cPsohlavci\u201d (Czech: Dog-heads) as their pennon featured the silhouette of a Bohemian sheepdog with a longer coat at the neck. Alois Jir\u00e1sek, writing in his 1884 novel \u201cPsohlavci\u201d concerning the Chodov\u00e9 revolt of 1695, used a Bohemian shepherd as a flag symbol for them. Writer Jindrich Simon bar wrote of \u201cChodsky dogs\u201d from the Sumava region in 1923, describing them as \"balanced and tenacious dogs used for guarding and protecting and rounding up cattle.\"  A modern breeding program for the Chodsk\u00fd pes began in 1984 and there are now many breeders. About 3,500 registered pups have been born since the program started (1984\u20132009).Despite their appearances, there is no evidence to suggest they are related to German Shepherd dogs.,The Bohemian Shepherd is medium sized, rectangular-shaped dog, standing 48-55 cm (19-22 inches) at the withers and weighing about 15-25 kg (35-55 lb). Long, thick fur and a rich undercoat allow him to survive in harsh weathers. The body is compact and well proportioned with high set, small, pointed, erect ears, and a long, elegant neckline.

It is true that these dogs do not seasonally moult or lose large amounts of fur as many other breeds do. However, they do eventually lose and replace individual hairs, similar to human hair growth cycles. Each hair grows from a hair follicle, which has a three phase cycle, as do most mammals. These cycles are: anagen, growth of normal hair; catagen growth slows, and hair shaft thins; telegen, hair growth stops, follicle rests, and old hair fall off\u2014is shed.

It is commonly kept as a companion dog; in 2013 it was in twelfth place on a list of the breeds most frequently registered worldwide.The Bulldog has a longstanding association with British culture; the BBC wrote: \"to many the Bulldog is a national icon, symbolising pluck and determination\". During the Second World War, the Prime Minister Winston Churchill was likened to a Bulldog for his defiance of Nazi Germany. The Bulldog Club (England) was formed in 1878, and the Bulldog Club of America was formed in 1890.,Bulldogs have characteristically wide heads and shoulders along with a pronounced mandibular prognathism. There are generally thick folds of skin on the brow; round, black, wide-set eyes; a short muzzle with characteristic folds called a rope or nose roll above the nose; hanging skin under the neck; drooping lips and pointed teeth, and an underbite with an upturned jaw. The coat is short, flat, and sleek with colours of red, fawn, white, brindle, and piebald.In the United Kingdom, the breed standards are 55 lb (25 kg) for a male and 50 lb (23 kg) for a female. In the United States, a typical mature male weighs 50 lb (23 kg), while mature females weigh about 40 lb (18 kg). The Bulldog Club of America recommends the average weight of a bulldog to be 40\u201350 lb (18\u201323 kg).Bulldogs are one of the few breeds whose tail is naturally short and either straight, screwed or thin and thus is not cut or docked as with some other breeds. A straight tail is a more desirable tail according to the breed standard set forth by the BCA if it is facing downward, not upward.,According to the American Kennel Club (AKC), a Bulldog's disposition should be \"equable and kind, resolute, and courageous (not vicious or aggressive), and demeanor should be pacifist and dignified. These attributes should be countenanced by the expression and behavior\"., Breeders have worked to reduce/remove aggression from these dogs. Most have a friendly, patient, but stubborn nature. Bulldogs are recognized as excellent family pets because of their tendency to form strong bonds with children.Generally, Bulldogs are known for getting along well with children, other dogs, and other pets.,The Cairn Terrier is a terrier breed originating in the Scottish Highlands and recognized as one of Scotland's earliest working dogs. The breed was given the name Cairn because the breed's function was to hunt and chase quarry between the cairns in the Scottish highlands.,Although the breed had existed long before, the name Cairn Terrier was a compromise suggestion after the breed originally was brought to official shows in the United Kingdom in 1909 under the name Short-haired Skye terriers. This name was not acceptable to The Kennel Club due to opposition from Skye Terrier breeders, and the name Cairn Terrier was suggested as an alternative.,Cairns originated in the Scottish Highlands and the Isle of Skye, initially grouped in the \"Skye Terrier\" class alongside the Scottish and West Highland White Terriers. In the early 1900s, the three breeds began to be bred separately.,The Kennel Club of the United Kingdom gave the Cairn Terrier a separate register in 1912; the first year of recognition, 134 were registered, and it was in that year that the breed was given Championship status.,The Cairn Terrier has a harsh weather-resistant outer coat that can be black, cream, wheaten, red, sandy, gray, or brindled in any of these colors. Pure black, black and tan, and white are not permitted by many kennel clubs. While registration of white Cairns was once permitted, after 1917, the American Kennel Club required them to be registered as West Highland White Terriers. A notable characteristic of Cairns is that brindled Cairns frequently change colour throughout their lifetimes. It is not uncommon for a brindled Cairn to become progressively more black or silver as it ages. The Cairn is double-coated, with a soft, dense undercoat and a harsh outer coat. A well-groomed Cairn has a rough-and-ready appearance, free of artifice or exaggeration. The Cairn Terrier was registered into the American Kennel Club in 1903.,Cairn Terriers tend to look similar to a Norwich Terrier, but with some differences (for example the shaggy fur). Their outer layer of fur is shaggy, but they have a soft, downy undercoat. Their ideal weight is also 4.5-7.3 kg (10-16 lb), and the height 9\u201313 in (23\u201333 cm).,The  Bulldog is a British breed of dog of mastiff type.

It is commonly kept as a companion dog; in 2013 it was in twelfth place on a list of the breeds most frequently registered worldwide.The Bulldog has a longstanding association with British culture; the BBC wrote: \"to many the Bulldog is a national icon, symbolising pluck and determination\". During the Second World War, the Prime Minister Winston Churchill was likened to a Bulldog for his defiance of Nazi Germany. The Bulldog Club (England) was formed in 1878, and the Bulldog Club of America was formed in 1890.,Bulldogs have characteristically wide heads and shoulders along with a pronounced mandibular prognathism. There are generally thick folds of skin on the brow; round, black, wide-set eyes; a short muzzle with characteristic folds called a rope or nose roll above the nose; hanging skin under the neck; drooping lips and pointed teeth, and an underbite with an upturned jaw. The coat is short, flat, and sleek with colours of red, fawn, white, brindle, and piebald.In the United Kingdom, the breed standards are 55 lb (25 kg) for a male and 50 lb (23 kg) for a female. In the United States, a typical mature male weighs 50 lb (23 kg), while mature females weigh about 40 lb (18 kg). The Bulldog Club of America recommends the average weight of a bulldog to be 40\u201350 lb (18\u201323 kg).Bulldogs are one of the few breeds whose tail is naturally short and either straight, screwed or thin and thus is not cut or docked as with some other breeds. A straight tail is a more desirable tail according to the breed standard set forth by the BCA if it is facing downward, not upward.,According to the American Kennel Club (AKC), a Bulldog's disposition should be \"equable and kind, resolute, and courageous (not vicious or aggressive), and demeanor should be pacifist and dignified. These attributes should be countenanced by the expression and behavior\"., Breeders have worked to reduce/remove aggression from these dogs. Most have a friendly, patient, but stubborn nature. Bulldogs are recognized as excellent family pets because of their tendency to form strong bonds with children.Generally, Bulldogs are known for getting along well with children, other dogs, and other pets.,The Cairn Terrier is a terrier breed originating in the Scottish Highlands and recognized as one of Scotland's earliest working dogs. The breed was given the name Cairn because the breed's function was to hunt and chase quarry between the cairns in the Scottish highlands.,Although the breed had existed long before, the name Cairn Terrier was a compromise suggestion after the breed originally was brought to official shows in the United Kingdom in 1909 under the name Short-haired Skye terriers. This name was not acceptable to The Kennel Club due to opposition from Skye Terrier breeders, and the name Cairn Terrier was suggested as an alternative.,Cairns originated in the Scottish Highlands and the Isle of Skye, initially grouped in the \"Skye Terrier\" class alongside the Scottish and West Highland White Terriers. In the early 1900s, the three breeds began to be bred separately.,The Kennel Club of the United Kingdom gave the Cairn Terrier a separate register in 1912; the first year of recognition, 134 were registered, and it was in that year that the breed was given Championship status.,The Cairn Terrier has a harsh weather-resistant outer coat that can be black, cream, wheaten, red, sandy, gray, or brindled in any of these colors. Pure black, black and tan, and white are not permitted by many kennel clubs. While registration of white Cairns was once permitted, after 1917, the American Kennel Club required them to be registered as West Highland White Terriers. A notable characteristic of Cairns is that brindled Cairns frequently change colour throughout their lifetimes. It is not uncommon for a brindled Cairn to become progressively more black or silver as it ages. The Cairn is double-coated, with a soft, dense undercoat and a harsh outer coat. A well-groomed Cairn has a rough-and-ready appearance, free of artifice or exaggeration. The Cairn Terrier was registered into the American Kennel Club in 1903.,Cairn Terriers tend to look similar to a Norwich Terrier, but with some differences (for example the shaggy fur). Their outer layer of fur is shaggy, but they have a soft, downy undercoat. Their ideal weight is also 4.5-7.3 kg (10-16 lb), and the height 9\u201313 in (23\u201333 cm)." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c441" }, "breed": "Campeiro Bulldog", "origin": "Brazil", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campeiro_Bulldog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Buldogue_Campeiro.jpg/220px-Buldogue_Campeiro.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e48" }, "breed": "Campeiro Bulldog", "contenido": "The Campeiro Bulldog (Portuguese: Buldogue campeiro, Portuguese pronunciation: [buw\u02c8d\u0254g \u02cck\u00e3\u02c8pei\u027e\u028a]) is a breed of bulldog from Brazil.,The Campeiro Bulldog was traditionally used in Brazil as a catch dog, catching and holding cattle, often in slaughterhouses.

It can be found in Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and the Sinai Peninsula, and these or dogs very similar are found in Egypt, Iraq, and Syria. It is the national dog of Israel. As of 2012, there were 2,000 to 3,000 Canaan Dogs across the world, mostly in Europe and North America.,The Canaan dog is also known as the Israel Canaan Dog, Bedouin Sheep dog and Palestinian Pariah Dog, The breed standard was created by Israeli Professor Rudolphina Menzel in 1966.,Since time immemorial, the Bedouins have used this dog for guarding their herds and camps. At the time of the Diaspora, the Israelites were forcefully removed from their land and according to tradition had to leave behind their dogs which reverted to the wild.Excavations in Israel unearthed the Ashkelon dog cemetery, the largest known animal cemetery in the ancient world, containing 700 dog skeletons, all of which were anatomically similar to the Canaan dog of modern times. The cemetery dates back to the time of occupation by the Persian Empire and archaeologists hypothesize that the dogs were revered as sacred animals.Dr. Rudolphina Menzel (1891\u20131973) used these intelligent scavenger-dogs mainly found in the desert as guard dogs. In the 1930s, Menzel was asked by the Haganah to build up a service dog organization. She captured a select group of semi-wild individuals, tamed, trained and bred them. Menzel found the dogs highly adaptable, trainable, and easy to domesticate. It took her about six months to capture her first dog, Dugma, and within a few weeks she was able to take him into town and on buses. She began a breeding program in 1934, providing working dogs for the military and she gave pups to be pets and home guard dogs. She initiated a selective breeding program to produce the breed known today as the Canaan dog.,In 1949, Menzel founded The Institute for Orientation and Mobility of the Blind, and in 1953, she started to train Canaan dogs as guide dogs for the blind. Although she was able to train several dogs, she found that the breed was too independent and too small for general guide dog use, although some of her dogs were used successfully by children. Her breeding program was concentrated with the Institute, where a foundation of kennel-raised Canaan dogs was established, carrying the name \"B'nei Habitachon\". In addition, a controlled collection of dogs of the original type was continued, primarily from the Bedouin of the Negev. She later supplied breeding stock to Shaar Hagai Kennels which continued in the breeding of the Canaan dog.After her death in 1973, Shaar Hagai Kennels, managed by Dvora Ben Shaul and Myrna Shiboleth, continued the breeding program according to her instructions.Collection of wild Canaan dogs in Israel has become very difficult, because many of the Canaan dogs living in the open there were destroyed by the Israeli government in the fight against rabies. The spread of the human population into areas that were formerly isolated, along with their pet dogs, has resulted in the loss of the natural habitat of the Canaan. Even the majority of Bedouin dogs today, other than those of tribes still living a traditional and isolated life style, are mixed with other breeds. It is possible that there are still original Canaans among Bedouin tribes that still live the traditional nomadic life elsewhere, and perhaps in Egypt. Myrna Shiboleth visits the Negev regularly, looking for good specimens living by the Bedouin camps, that she can breed with her dogs and use to strengthen the gene pool." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c446" }, "breed": "Cane Paratore", "origin": "Italy", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cane_Paratore", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Cane_Paratore.jpg/220px-Cane_Paratore.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e4e" }, "breed": "Cane Paratore", "contenido": "The Cane Paratore is a breed of herding dog from Italy, the breed primarily exists in its traditional role in Abruzzo, its historical region of origin, having not gained popularity from outside dog fanciers.In 2018 a genetic study found that, just prior to 1859, a broadly distributed European herding dog had given rise to the German Shepherd Dog, the French Berger Picard, and the five Italian herding breeds: the Bergamasco Shepherd, Cane Paratore, Lupino del Gigante, Pastore d'Oropa, and the Pastore della Lessinia e del Lagorai.,Video: Cane Paratore rounding up sheep,Cane Paratore/Toccatore Italiano history: http://www.dicasamarziali.com/en/cane-toccatore-history.html" }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c448" }, "breed": "C\u00e3o da Serra de Aires", "origin": "Portugal", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A3o_da_Serra_de_Aires", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Cao_de_Serra_de_Aires600.jpg/220px-Cao_de_Serra_de_Aires600.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e7a" }, "breed": "C\u00e3o da Serra de Aires", "contenido": "The Cantabrian Water Dog (Spanish: perro de agua cant\u00e1brico) is a landrace breed of dog developed in the coast of Cantabria, northern Spain, as an assistant to fishermen.

Mrs Neville Lytton\" in 1911.,In 1926, the American Roswell Eldridge offered a dog show class prize of 25 pounds of sterling silver each as a prize for the best male and females of \"Blenheim Spaniels of the old type, as shown in pictures of Charles II of England's time, long face, no stop, flat skull, not inclined to be domed, with spot in centre of skull.\" The breeders of the era were appalled, although several entered what they considered to be sub-par Cavalier King Charles Spaniels in the competition. Eldridge died before seeing his plan come to fruition, but several breeders believed in what he said and in 1928 the first Cavalier club was formed. The first standard was created, based on a dog named \"Ann's Son\" owned by Mostyn Walker, and the Kennel Club recognised the variety as \"King Charles Spaniels, Cavalier type\".The Second World War caused a drastic setback to the emerging breed, with the vast majority of breeding stock destroyed because of wartime hardship and food shortages. For instance, in the Ttiweh Cavalier Kennel, the population of 60 dogs dropped to three during the 1940s. Following the war, few dogs survived as the new beginning from which all present-day Cavaliers descend. And in 1945, the Kennel Club first recognised the breed in its own right as the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.The history of the breed in America is relatively recent. The first recorded Cavalier living in the United States was brought from the United Kingdom in 1956 by W. Lyon Brown who, together with Elizabeth Spalding and other enthusiasts, founded the Cavalier King Charles Club USA that continues to the present day. In 1994, the American Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club was created by a group of breeders to apply for recognition by the American Kennel Club. The Cavalier would go on to be recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1995, and the ACKCSC became the parent club for Cavaliers.,The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a small breed of spaniel classed in the toy group of The Kennel Club and the American Kennel Club that originated in the United Kingdom. Since 2000, it has grown in popularity in the United States and ranks as the 17th most popular pure-breed in the United States.   It has a silky, smooth coat and commonly a smooth undocked tail. The breed standard recognises four colours: Blenheim (chestnut and white), tricolour (black/white/tan), black and tan, and ruby. The breed is generally friendly, placid, and good with both children and other animals; however, they require much human interaction. Since they are family dogs, it is recommended to not leave one alone for long periods at a time. The expected lifespan of a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is between nine and 14 years.The Cavalier King Charles changed dramatically in the late 17th century, when it was interbred with flat-nosed breeds. Until the 1920s, the Cavalier shared the same history as the smaller King Charles Spaniel.

Traditionally, the breed was used for guarding sheep and goat herds, as well as to protect and for guard duty.,It is a large breed of dog recognized by FCI as a Molossoid type dog breed of Soviet-era origin under Russian patronage. Numerous breed representatives reside in Russia, and local kennel club officials refer to Central Asians as one of the most popular dog breeds in the country, rating them as the #1 breed in the country around 2000.,The ancestor of the Central Asian shepherd originated in a geographical area between the Ural, Caspian Sea, Asia Minor, and the Northwest border of China. Aboriginal Central Asians as well as mixes still can be found in its countries of origin, such as, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and surrounding countries. It is considered a symbol of pride and national heritage in Turkmenistan, where a gold statue of the animal was unveiled in 2020. Some serve as livestock guardians, some protect their owners, and some are used for dog fighting, which is a national tradition in many countries of that region. This breed bears a strong genetic similarity to other aboriginal breeds of Livestock Guardian dogs from that region such as Georgian Shepherd (Nagazi), Kangal dog, and Akbash.Russian biologists and scientists have studied the local dog population since the 18th century. After the Communist revolution, the Soviet government focused on working dog breeds for the Red Army, and imported the best breed representatives to Russia as per military dogs' and guard dogs' requirements.  Over the decades, this practice harmed the local population. The introduction of new breeds to the region led to crossbreeding. Eventually, purebred dogs only remained with herders, breed enthusiasts and farms, with a surfeit of crosses elsewhere. However, the Central Asian Shepherd Dog population is still stable in general, reproducing some true quality dogs praised for working abilities, regardless of country of origin. Trading bloodlines and purchasing unrelated breeding stock between Russia, other former USSR republics (such as Ukraine, Belarus etc. ) and countries where CAO (Central Asian Ovtcharka) still at aboriginal stage is a common practice nowadays.\t\t,This breed comprises numerous breed types. They differ in size, color, head types, and hair types. Central Asians tend to form a social group, consisting of different members bearing different duties; thus puppies with different working qualities are normally born in the same litter. These breed features, as well as different traditional names for the breed, give grounds for complications with breed standard. Most important, purebred Central Asians have unique breed characteristics. Breed-specific dog anatomy includes exclusive features, such as very noticeable extremely flexible joints, false ribs, specific head set, and very strong neck with massive dewlap. Expressive, almost human eyes, revealing inimitable intelligence, finish the portrait.,For working qualities, modern Central Asians have been bred into different directions, depending on the demand for specific abilities. Traditional dog fighting had always been a national tradition in places of original habitat, but they had never been cruel and destructive as pitbull-type fights. All herders from the same area annually met together, and fought their strongest sheep guardian male dogs to pick the winner. It was about dominance rather than destroying their own kind. Most dogs evaluated each other when met at the field and the weaker or more submissive dog left, taking the loss. Dogs seldom injured each other, inflicting mostly minor scratches within a short period of time. Only true leaders actually had to determine the strongest dog via a real fight; but this was minor, compared to their everyday duties, facing predators and venomous snakes.,Modern commercial dog fights often differ from traditional as much as livestock guardian dogs differ from fighting dogs. There are different rules, and different breeds involved. Most Central Asians used for modern commercial fights come from fighting lines. The majority of breeders are aware of their dogs\u2019 backgrounds, and will tell whether the dog comes from lines used for fighting. One can always expect a high level of aggression toward other dogs from CAOs with a dog fighting background. It is always important to distinguish whether a dog will display aggression only toward strange, unfriendly dogs entering their territory, while establishing and maintaining the usual social relationships with other animals on the premises; or will attack regardless of whether the other dog is a member of the same social group. Promiscuity in aggression toward strangers and friends is highly atypical for the breed.,Central Asians are still in demand as livestock guardians, though not nearly as much as they used to be. These dogs, to differing degrees, are protective against human intruders; they are very territorial, safe with children; they love and respect elderly people, protect all small animals from predators, and are very gentle with family members.Dogs for personal protection or working dogs originated from livestock guardian dogs, selectively bred by Russian breed experts for working abilities. As a result, they excel in obedience, territory protection, and personal protection, and are very intelligent. As such, they make perfect house dogs. They do not need any complicated training to learn basic house rules, and treat the owner with the same great respect with which their ancestors treated the herder. These dogs were introduced to the worldwide sheep breeding community with great success. Guard dogs must be able to work as a team to protect sheep against predators; thus excessively aggressive CAOs, as with any other dogs, cannot be members of the pack, and will not pass this simple test for compliance with the breed origination purpose.,Central Asian Shepherd dogs can come from working lines, fighting lines, and livestock guardian lines, and behave accordingly, regardless of the country they come from. Simple pedigree research and conversation with the breeder will reveal what basic instincts one can expect from the dog. Central Asians from pure show lines are very rare, because most registries require working tests prior to breeding." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c452" }, "breed": "Cesky Terrier", "origin": "Czech Republic", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesky_Terrier", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Terier_czeski_suka_2009_pl2.jpg/220px-Terier_czeski_suka_2009_pl2.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c67e" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/cesky_terrier.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 2, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 4, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 3, "energy": 3, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 15, "max_height_male": 13, "max_height_female": 13, "max_weight_male": 24, "max_weight_female": 24, "min_height_male": 10, "min_height_female": 10, "min_weight_male": 14, "min_weight_female": 14, "breed": "Cesky Terrier" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e5b" }, "breed": "Cesky Terrier", "contenido": "The Cesky Terrier ( CHES-kee; Czech: \u010cesk\u00fd teri\u00e9r, lit.

Although not a trained scientist, Hor\u00e1k worked for many years as a research assistant at the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences and used knowledge gained there in his dog breeding. Czechoslovakia was ruled by a communist regime at the time; when Hor\u00e1k's dogs became more popular around the world, he began to receive a large volume of mail from outside the country, which earned him the attention of the secret police. Hor\u00e1k died in 1997.,The Cesky Terrier was recognized for international competition by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 1963 as breed number 246 in Group 3, Terriers. The breed is now recognized by all of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world. The Cesky Terrier is one of the six most rare dog breeds worldwide.The breed was first imported into the US in the 1980s by a group of enthusiasts. They formed the Cesky Terrier Club of America in January 1988. As interest grew, the breed became eligible to join the American Kennel Club (AKC) Foundation Stock Service Program from January 1, 2004 allowing it to compete in AKC Earthdog tests. At this stage the American Cesky Terrier Fanciers Association was formed and recognised by the AKC. It is the club accepted as the parent club by the AKC. However, the Cesky Terrier Club of America remains active in promoting the breed in the USA.,From mid-2011, the Cesky Terrier was able to compete in the terrier group in America as it was accepted for entry in the AKC Stud Book.The breed first arrived in the UK in 1989 and had to compete from the imported register. The Cesky Terrier was recognised by the Kennel Club (UK) in 1990 and on January 1, 2000 it gained rare breed status. It has since competed successfully in show competition in the UK.,The Cesky Terrier is a well-muscled, short legged, well-pigmented, hunting terrier of a rectangular format. The Cesky has natural drop ears, a natural tail, and sports a long, silky with slight texture coat in shades of gray from charcoal to platinum (black pigmented) or rarely brown (liver pigmented).

Like most hairless dog breeds, the Chinese Crested Dog comes in three varieties, with hair, without hair and a combination of the two, which can be born in the same litter: the Powderpuff , the Hairless and the Hairy-Hairless.,This breed is considered small; 10\u201313 lb (4.5\u20135.9 kg).,At first look, the Hairless and Powderpuff varieties of Chinese Crested Dogs appear to be two different breeds, but hairlessness is an incomplete dominant trait within a single breed. The Hairless has soft, humanlike skin, as well as tufts of hair on its paws (\"socks\") and tail (\"plume\") and long, flowing hair on its head (\"crest\"). In addition to being an incomplete dominant gene, the \"hairless\" gene has a prenatal lethal effect when homozygous. Zygotes affected with double hairless genes never develop into puppies, and are reabsorbed in the womb. All Hairless Chinese Crested Dogs are therefore heterozygous.,The Hairless variety can vary in amount of body hair.  Hair on the muzzle, known as a beard, is not uncommon. A true Hairless often does not have as much furnishings (hair on the head, tail, and paws). The difference between a very hairy Hairless and a Powderpuff is that the Hairless has a single coat with hairless parts on the body, while the Powderpuff has a thick double coat.  The skin of the Hairless comes in a variety of colors, ranging from a pale flesh to black. Hairless Chinese Crested Dogs often lack a full set of premolar teeth, but this is not considered a fault.A Powderpuff has a long, soft coat. Both Hairless and Powderpuff varieties can appear in the same litter.  The look of the Powderpuff varies according to how it is groomed. When its hair is completely grown out on its face, it strongly resembles a terrier; however, the Powderpuff is usually shaved around the snout as a standard cut. The Powderpuff Chinese Crested Dog is an elegant and graceful dog who makes a loving companion, playful and entertaining. The Powderpuff's coat is long and silky soft. Ears are large and erect.,The amount of body hair on the Hairless variety varies quite extensively, from the true hairless which has very little or no body hair and furnishings, to what is called a \"hairy Hairless\" dog, which, if left ungroomed, often grows a near-full coat of hair. These hairy Hairless dogs are not a mix between Powderpuffs and Hairless Chinese Crested Dogs, but are merely a result of a weaker expression of the variable Hairless gene.  The mutation responsible for the hairless trait was identified in 2008.,Both varieties require certain amounts of grooming. The Powderpuff is entirely covered with a double, very soft, straight coat.  Although a Powderpuff's coat does not continuously grow, it can grow to be quite long at full length.  A weekly bath and frequent brushing will help prevent matting. For an optimal coat, never brush when dry or dirty. A light spray of water or grooming spray to their coat is recommended before brushing. Many choose to shave their Powderpuff in a \"Pony Cut\" leaving long hair on the bottom of legs, tail, head and crest for an easy care coat. Powderpuffs are very clean and have no odor. This breed has \"little to no shedding\". (see Moult).,Maintenance of the Hairless variety's skin is similar to maintaining human skin and as such it can be susceptible to acne, dryness, and sunburn. Hypoallergenic or oil-free moisturizing cream can keep the skin from becoming too dry when applied every other day or after bathing. Burning can occur in regions that are subject to strong UV radiation, especially in lighter-skinned dogs. Many owners apply baby sunscreen to their pets before spending time in strong sun. Some Chinese Crested Dogs have skin allergies to lanolin, so be cautious when using any products that contain it." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c45d" }, "breed": "Curly-Coated Retriever", "origin": "United Kingdom - England", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curly_Coated_Retriever", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Curly_Coated_Retriever.jpg/220px-Curly_Coated_Retriever.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c683" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/curly-coated_retriever.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 2, "grooming": 1, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 4, "trainability": 4, "energy": 4, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 12, "max_height_male": 27, "max_height_female": 27, "max_weight_male": 95, "max_weight_female": 95, "min_height_male": 25, "min_height_female": 25, "min_weight_male": 60, "min_weight_female": 60, "breed": "Curly-Coated Retriever" }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c724" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/curly-coated_retriever.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 2, "grooming": 1, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 4, "trainability": 4, "energy": 4, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 12, "max_height_male": 27, "max_height_female": 27, "max_weight_male": 95, "max_weight_female": 95, "min_height_male": 25, "min_height_female": 25, "min_weight_male": 60, "min_weight_female": 60, "breed": "Curly-Coated Retriever" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e76" }, "breed": "Curly-Coated Retriever", "contenido": "The Curly-coated Retriever (not always hyphenated, and often called the Curly for short) is a breed of dog originally bred in England for upland bird and waterfowl hunting.

The breed were originally used as Border patrol dogs but were later also used in search and rescue, Schutzhund sport, tracking, herding, agility, obedience, hunting, and drafting in Europe and the United States.,It was officially recognized as a national breed in Czechoslovakia in 1982, and was officially recognised as a breed by F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) in 1989.,In 1955, Karel Hartl began to consider crossing a Carpathian grey wolf with a German Shepherd (German: Deutscher Sch\u00e4ferhund, Czech: N\u011bmeck\u00fd ov\u010d\u00e1k, Slovak: Nemeck\u00fd ov\u010diak) as a scientific experiment in the military kennels in Czechoslovakia. A few years later, however, the idea was born to establish a new breed. The first hybrids of a female wolf named Brita and a male German Shepherd named C\u00e9zar were born on 26 May 1958 in Lib\u011bjovice.,Puppies of the first generation resembled the wolf in appearance and behavior. Their upbringing was difficult; training was possible, but the results hardly matched the effort. In adulthood, they were again bred with German Shepherds, decreasing the proportion of wolf blood to 6.25% in the fourth generation. Most individuals of the third and fourth generations were able to attend a normal course and could be placed in service performance. Compared with dogs they had better navigational skills, night vision, hearing, and sense of smell. In tests of endurance, hybrids finished the entire 100 km route without being exhausted.,A lecture by Hartl, \"Results of crossing wolves with dogs\", brought major attention at the World Dog Show held in June 1965 in Brno and in Prague at the annual meeting of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) and the International Cynologic Congress. In the following year, Ing. Hartl compiled a draft standard of a new dog breed. Mating of the wolf Brita with the German Shepherd Kurt then created the basis of a second line. A third line was made by joining the wolf Argo with the female German Shepherd Asta from the SNB. In 1977, a third-generation hybrid female named Xela of the border guards was covered by the wolf Sarika; he also mated with the female Orta of the border guards. ,However, the breed-in-foundation repeatedly refused recognition, and in the 1970s, most breeding dogs were moved to the Slovak military kennels near Malacky, under the supervision of Vice commander Major Franti\u0161ek Ros\u00edk. In 1971\u20131981, litters were born only in Slovakia. In 1982, the Club of Czechoslovak Wolfdog Breeders (Klub chovatel\u016f \u010deskoslovensk\u00e9ho vl\u010d\u00e1ka) was founded in Brno, with authority over the entire territory of former Czechoslovakia.,In 1982, the breed was again presented for recognition by Franti\u0161ek Ros\u00edk through the Club of Czechoslovak Wolfdog Breeders (now divided into Czech and Slovak Breed Club), and this time, it was recognized by the Czechoslovak breeders' associations as a national breed. The last addition of wolf blood took place in 1983. The wolf Lejdy of Ohrada Zoo in Hlubok\u00e1 nad Vltavou gave birth to the last line of the new breed, the father of the puppies being the German Shepherd Bojar von Shottenhof. Since that time, breeding has been carried out only in closed populations and the developed breed referred to as Czechoslovak Wolfdogs.,In 1989, it became provisionally recognized as FCI standard no. 332, group 1, section 1. It won the title of \"World Champion\" at the World Dog Show in Brno in 1990. Ten years later, in 1999, the breed confirmed its viability and met all the criteria of the FCI, earning full recognition of the Czechoslovak Wolfdog breed.,In 2012, the breed numbered 168 adult females and 170 adult males officially registered in the Czech Republic. As of January 2014, the most puppies each year are registered in Italy (up to two hundred), in the Czech Republic (about 100), and in Slovakia (about 50). The breed is growing in popularity in the UK too, with a number of Czechoslovak Wolfdogs working in Search and Rescue,  supported by a dedicated Breed Club.

However, it has the official national recognition of the Asociaci\u00f3n Canofila Guatemalteca (ACANGUA) where it belongs to the Group 2.2.1 - Mastiffs. As a unique breed originating in Guatemala, it is also the national dog of the country. It has been introduced to some other countries.,The breed was created from crosses between the old type Bull Terrier, Boxer, and Dalmatian at the end of the 19th century. The two most remarkable breeders in the early history were the family Gerardi in the 1910s and the family Gallusser in the 1930s. Because of the significant Bull Terrier influence and similar appearance (the original Bull Terrier resembled more Latin American Dogos than the modern breed does), in the 20th century it was called Bullterrier Guatemalteco. Finally at the end of the 20th century, the ACANGUA officially changed the name to the Dogo Guatemalteco. Although the ACANGUA published the first official standard already in 1972, the FCI has still not considered international recognition of the breed; however, the American Dog Federation recognizes the Guatemalan Dogo and recognizes the ACANGUA standard as the official standard. The Guatemalan Dog is categorized in working group 6.,The Guatemalan Dogo is a type of mastiff. It is a medium-sized, robust, strong and agile dog with an appearance similar to the Dogo Argentino and the Dogue Brasileiros - however, these breeds are not closely related, but only share partially same ancestors. Males are 54 \u2013 60 cm tall and weigh 40 \u2013 45 kg; females 52 \u2013 58 cm tall and weigh 35 \u2013 40 kg. The short, shiny coat has a smooth and hard texture. The colour must always be white in the body, but in the head markings or spots of any other colour are preferred (although not required).,The Guatemalan Dogo is fearless, balanced and stable. Towards its family, it is obedient, tranquil, loyal, and affectionate. However, it is reserved and alert towards strangers and will usually accept only the friends of the family.

A typical brachycephalic mastiff breed, the Bordeaux is a very powerful dog, with a very muscular body. This muscular breed has been put to work pulling carts, transporting heavy objects, and guarding flocks.,The Dogue de Bordeaux was known in France as early as the 14th century, particularly in southern France in the region around Bordeaux. Hence, the city lent its name to this large dog. The breed was first exhibited in France in 1863 after which time it gained in popularity not only in their home country but in other parts of the world. The first record of the Dogue de Bordeaux in the UK can be seen in the Kennel Club Gazette in 1897. The breed was officially recognised by the Kennel Club (UK) in 1997 but it was not until 2001 that the Kennel Club (UK) accepted an interim breed standard. A uniform breed type of the Bordeaux dog did not exist before about 1920.The French placed emphasis on keeping the old breeding line pure. Black masks were considered an indication of the crossing in of the English Mastiff. As an important indication of purity of the breed, attention was paid to the self-colored (pink) nose, lighter eye color (dark amber), and red mask. They were originally bred with huge heads; a pioneer for the breed in Germany, Werner Preugschat once wrote:,What am I supposed to do with a dog that has a monstrous skull and is at most able to carry it from the food dish to its bed?,The Dogue de Bordeaux was at one time known to come in two varieties, Dogues and Doguins, the Dogue being considerably larger than the Doguin. The smaller Doguin has withered away to nothing more than a mention in breed history books and is now extinct.,The history of the breed is believed to predate the Bullmastiff and the Bulldog. It is said that the Dogue can be found in the background of the Bullmastiff, and others claim that the Dogue and mastiff breeds were both being accomplished at the same time. Another theory is the Dogue de Bordeaux originates from the Tibetan Mastiff and it is also said that the Dogue is related to the Greek Molossus used for war.As there was a breed similar to the Dogue de Bordeaux in Rome at the time of Julius Caesar's reign, possibly a cousin of the Neapolitan Mastiff. Others suggest that the Dogue de Bordeaux is a descendant of a breed which existed in ancient France, the Dogues de Bordeaux of Aquitaine. Whichever theory is true, the Dogue de Bordeaux shares the same common links as all modern mastiffs.,The Dogue de Bordeaux was once classified into three varieties, the Parisian, the Toulouse and the Bordeaux, types which were bred depending on the region of France and the jobs it was required to do. The ancestral Dogue de Bordeaux had various coat colors, such as brindle and a majority of white markings that carried fully up the legs. It had scissor bites in some regions, undershot in others; a big head or a small head, a large body or a small body; very inconsistent in type. Another controversial aspect was the mask, red (brown), black or none. The Dogue de Bordeaux of Bordeaux of the time also sported cropped ears. Regardless, it had a general type similar to today's Dogue de Bordeaux." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c46a" }, "breed": "Dutch Smoushond", "origin": "Netherlands", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Smoushond", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Hollandse_Smoushond_Amsterdam_cropped.jpg/220px-Hollandse_Smoushond_Amsterdam_cropped.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e91" }, "breed": "Dutch Smoushond", "contenido": "The Dutch Smoushond (Hollandse Smoushond, Dutch Ratter) is a small breed of dog, related to the Pinscher and Schnauzer breed type kept in stables to eliminate rats and mice in Germany and the Netherlands. It is very rare and not well known outside the Netherlands, its country of origin.,The Dutch Smoushond is small in size, at the maximum 10 kg in weight and  43 cm at the withers. Its waterproof coat is rough and shaggy, and of any shade of yellow colour. The characteristic shape of the head is broad and short, with drop ears set high on the head.,The Hollandse Smoushond Club (Smoushondenclub) was formed in 1905 to document and register the small stable dog as a purebred breed, as it was in danger of dying out. Its origins may have been with the ancestor of the Schnauzer breed, as an incorrect yellow colour. The name refers to its shaggy fur and face, as Jewish men (called Smouzen in the 1800s, a slur deriving from the name Moses) had beards and long hair. They were called \"Dutch\" to prevent confusion with the similar Brussels Griffons.  During World War II, the breed nearly disappeared. In 1973, several breeders began to reconstruct the breed with the few remaining dogs, most of whom had been crossbred with other breeds.

It is widely known as a wonderful companion that maintains its own personality, has a dignified reserve with strangers, has a strong bond to its family, and is relatively easy to train.,The Eurasier is a balanced, well-constructed, medium-sized Spitz (Spitzen) type dog with prick ears. It comes in different colors: fawn, red, wolf-grey, solid black, and black and tan. All color combinations are allowed, except for pure white, white patches, and liver color. F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) standards call for the Eurasier to have a thick undercoat and medium-long, loosely lying guard hair all over the body, with a short coat on the muzzle, face, ears, and front legs. The tail and the back of the front legs (feathers) and hind legs (breeches) should be covered with long hair. The coat on the Eurasier's neck should be slightly longer than on the body, but not forming a mane. The breed may have a pink, blue-black, or spotted tongue.,The male has a height of 52 to 60 cm (20\u201323.5 inches) at the withers and weighs between 23 and 32 kg (50\u201370 lb) and the female has a height of 48 to 56 cm (19\u201322 inches) at the withers and weighs between 18 and 26 kg (40\u201357 lb).,Eurasiers are calm, even-tempered dogs. They are watchful and alert, yet reserved towards strangers without being timid or aggressive. Eurasiers form a strong link to their families. For the full development of these qualities, the Eurasier needs constant close contact with its family, combined with understanding, yet consistent, training. They are extremely sensitive to harsh words or discipline and respond best to positive reinforcement. The Eurasier is a combination of the best qualities of the Chow Chow, the Keeshond, and the Samoyed, resulting in a dignified, intelligent breed.,Eurasiers were bred as companion dogs; as such, they do poorly in a kennel environment such as those commonly used for institutionally trained service dogs, nor are they well suited for the social stresses of working as a sled or guard dog. Eurasiers should never be restricted to only a yard, kennel, crate, or chained up. They would pine and become depressed. Within these limitations, Eurasiers can work very well as therapy dogs.  This breed enjoys all kinds of activities, especially if the activities involve their family.

Rather than attacking its prey, the Fila traps it and waits for the hunter to arrive. Owing to these qualities, the Fila Brasileiro is used as a guard dog, and as a dog fighting dog, as a cattle dog for livestock and as a hunting dog for tracking and controlling large game.,When slavery was legal in Brazil in the 18th century, the Fila Brasileiro was used to return fugitive slaves to their masters.,The verb \"filar\" in Portuguese literally means \"to hold, arrest, grab\". So \"c\u00e3o de fila\" (fila dog) or \"c\u00e3o de filar\" suggests that it is a catch dog, a dog that \"bites and does not loosen its grip\". A similar name is also found in two Portuguese dog breeds: the C\u00e3o de Fila de S\u00e3o Miguel and the extinct C\u00e3o de Fila da Terceira.,The Fila Brasileiro is thought to descend from European dogs brought to Brazil during the Colonial period, with little or no influence from indigenous South American dogs from the Pre-Cabraline era.The Fila Brasileiro were bred and raised primarily on large plantations and cattle farms where they originated. In addition to cattle, jaguars, and other animals, these dogs were taught to chase down runaway slaves.The first written standard of the breed was edited in 1946. The Paulistas were responsible for organizing a planned breeding program and opening a stud book to register dogs. Dr. Paulo Santos Cruz began to systematically breed the Fila Brasileiro and also contributed largely in setting the CAFIB standard, and who now, therefore, has the right to be called the \"father\" of the Fila Brasileiro.About the registries, CBKC (Brazilian Confederation Kennel Club) follows the FCI (Federation Cynologique Internationale) policy and accepts for registration only dogs with FCI pedigrees, orienting the breeders to have hip dysplasia control, besides other health problems.

It was developed in France and Canada as a hunting dog, descended from dogs of the 14th century. Popular with royalty during the Middle Ages, it nearly became extinct by the turn of the 20th century but was saved by the efforts of Father Fournier, a French priest. One of the largest breeds of Spaniel, it typically has a white coat with brown markings. It is a friendly breed that has few health issues, but can be affected by a syndrome called acral mutilation and analgesia. The breed is recognised by Canadian and international kennel clubs but not by The Kennel Club (UK). The American Kennel Club has included the breed in its Foundation Stock Service, the first step to full recognition.,Spaniels were first mentioned in France during the 14th century in Gaston III of Foix-B\u00e9arn's work Livre de chasse, later translated into English as The Master of Game. The French Spaniel was referred to as a specific type of Spaniel by 1660 and was noted as being distinctive from the King Charles Spaniel of the Holland type.The breed was popular during the Middle Ages with it used for falconry and as a settling dog for net hunting. They became a favourite of French Royalty and Kings and Princes at the royal courts of Versailles favored them over other breeds of hunting dogs. In addition, Catherine I of Russia (1684\u20131727) was known to have owned a French Spaniel named Babe. During this period, the French Spaniel was known to have split into several regional types.The Sporting Magazine wrote of the French Spaniel and the hunting of mallards in 1805, \"The rough French Spaniel has been found the best companion on these occasions: he watches the conduct of the sportsman, and, with a velocity unequalled, darts on the wounded prey, presents it with all possible speed at the feet of his master.\" In the 1850s, the Brittany (formerly known as Brittany Spaniel) was developed from crossing French Spaniels with English Setters.James de Connick established the first breed standard for the French Spaniel in 1891. At the turn of the 20th century, the numbers of French Spaniels dropped so low that they nearly became extinct due to competition from foreign sporting dogs, in particular as French hunters chose to hunt particularly with English breeds of hunting dogs. A French priest named Father Fournier undertook the task of gathering the remaining French Spaniels in his Saint Hillaire kennels in order to preserve the breed. There he built the lineages that are representatives of those we now have. The French Spaniel Club was founded in 1921, with Father Fournier as the president of the association. The modern French Spaniel is one of a group of recognised French Spaniels, including the Brittany, Picardy and Blue Picardy.,The French Spaniel was little known outside France and neighboring countries until it was introduced in the Canadian province of Quebec in the 1970s. It quickly became a popular dog for hunting woodcock and grouse. The Club de l'\u00c9pagneul Fran\u00e7ais du Canada was formed in 1978 to ensure the French Spaniel would continue to meet breed standards and to pursue official recognition by the Canadian Kennel Club, by which the breed was recognised in 1985.French Spaniels are also recognized by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, and the United Kennel Club. The Kennel Club (UK) and the American Kennel Club do not recognize the French Spaniel, but is recognised by the North American Versatile Hunting Dog Association, and can be registered with US dog registries in order to record their registries and compete in associated dog shows, such as the Dog Registry of America, American Canine Association, and America's Pet Registry.To qualify for recognition by the American Kennel Club, a national breed club must first be established and a written request needs to be sent to the AKC along with a breed standard. This enables qualification for the Foundation Stock Service. The next step is to qualify to compete in the Miscellaneous Class. This requires a minimum of one hundred active members in the national breed club, along with a minimum of three to four hundred dogs in the United States with a three generation pedigree (all dogs in those pedigrees must be of the same breed). In addition, they must be geographically spread across twenty states or more, and finally the clubs by-laws and constitution must be reviewed as well as breed observations made by AKC staff. There is a typical stay of between one and three years in the Miscellaneous Class before full recognition is granted. During this time, the breed club must be seen to be active and hold seminars, matches as well as local and national speciality shows. The Kennel Club (UK) does not have a miscellaneous class or foundation stock service, instead it requires British bred dog and three generation pedigrees of them, along with details from the country of origin including the breed standard. This allows listing on the Imported Breeds Register, with full recognition granted at the discretion of the Kennel Club Review Committee." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c486" }, "breed": "German Shorthaired Pointer", "origin": "Germany", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Shorthaired_Pointer", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Duitse_staande_korthaar_10-10-2.jpg/220px-Duitse_staande_korthaar_10-10-2.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c697" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/german_shorthaired_pointer.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 4, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 4, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 4, "trainability": 5, "energy": 5, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 12, "max_height_male": 25, "max_height_female": 25, "max_weight_male": 70, "max_weight_female": 60, "min_height_male": 23, "min_height_female": 23, "min_weight_male": 55, "min_weight_female": 45, "breed": "German Shorthaired Pointer" }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6d8" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/german_shorthaired_pointer.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 4, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 4, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 4, "trainability": 5, "energy": 5, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 12, "max_height_male": 25, "max_height_female": 25, "max_weight_male": 70, "max_weight_female": 60, "min_height_male": 23, "min_height_female": 23, "min_weight_male": 55, "min_weight_female": 45, "breed": "German Shorthaired Pointer" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5eb5" }, "breed": "German Shorthaired Pointer", "contenido": "The German Shorthaired Pointer (GSP) is a medium to large sized breed of pointing dog developed in the 19th century in Germany for hunting.

The GSP's distinctly independent character means that any unused energy will likely result in the dog amusing itself, most probably in an undesirable manner. Most German Shorthaired Pointers make excellent watchdogs, as they are naturally a very vocal dog. The breed generally gets along well with other dogs, but a strong hunting instinct is normal for the breed, which is not always good for other small pets such as cats or rabbits.,Failure by the owner to give this active and intelligent dog sufficient exercise and/or proper training can produce a German Shorthaired Pointer that appears hyperactive or that has destructive tendencies. Thus, the breed is not a suitable pet for an inactive home or for inexperienced dog owners.  Although these dogs form very strong attachments with their owners, a bored GSP that receives insufficient exercise may feel compelled to exercise himself.  These dogs are athletic and can escape from four- to six-foot enclosures with little difficulty. Regular hunting, running, carting, bikejoring, skijoring, mushing, dog scootering or other vigorous activity can alleviate this desire to escape.,The German Shorthaired Pointer (GSP) is a medium to large sized breed of pointing dog developed in the 19th century in Germany for hunting. A versatile hunting breed, being an all-purpose gun dog suitable for both land and water, they are streamlined yet powerful with strong legs. While a hunting breed that retains a strong drive to find and chase game, they are extremely energetic and can excel at a wide variety of dog sports. Their demeanor when well-socialized is friendly toward both people and fellow canines, with some tendency to be \"velcro dogs\".,The German Shorthaired Pointer has a short coat that comes in various combinations, generally a mix of liver and white. They have moderately long floppy ears set high on the head. Longer, broad, and strong, muzzles allow retrieval of heavier game. The dog's profile should be straight or strongly Roman nosed; any dished appearance to the profile is incorrect according to breed standards. Their eyes are generally brown, with darker eyes being desirable; yellow or \"bird of prey\" eyes are a fault. The tail is commonly docked, although this is now prohibited in some countries. In competition they are penalized if the tail is curved either up or down while the dog is moving. When the GSP is in classic point stance, the tail should be held straight out from the body, forming a line with the pointing head and body. Like all German pointers, GSPs have webbed feet  and are known for going after waterfowl in the water.,The German Shorthaired Pointer is a member of the Sporting Group. In 2016, CJ, a 3-year-old German Shorthaired Pointer, won the Best in Show award at the 140th Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.,The German Shorthaired Pointer's coat is short and flat with a dense undercoat protected by stiff guard hairs making the coat water resistant and allowing the dog to stay warm in cold weather. This allows the German Shorthaired Pointer to be an agile hunter with high performance in both field and water. The color can be a dark brown with some lighter brown colors, referred to as \"liver\" (incorrectly as \"chocolate\" or \"chestnut\"), black (although any area of black is cause for disqualification in American Kennel Club-sanctioned shows), white, liver roan, or liver and white. Commonly, the head is a solid or nearly solid color, and the body is speckled or \"ticked\" with liver and white, sometimes with large patches of solid color called \"saddles.\" Roan coats are also common, with or without patching. Solid liver and solid black coats also occur, often with a small blaze of ticking or white on the chest. While the German standard permits a slight sandy colouring (\"Gelber Brand\") at the extremities, this colouring is rare, and a dog displaying any yellow colouring is disqualified in AKC and CKC shows. The colouring of the GSP provides camouflage in the winter seasons. The coat can be very glossy if washed.,The GSP coat is easy to take care of, but they shed a lot. Although their coat is short, they do shed. They shed more at certain times throughout the year. If that isn't taken care of their hairs can be embedded in fabrics and carpet and it will be difficult to get it out. All it takes is to brush regularly with a firm bristle brush, along with baths when necessary.,The temperament of dogs can be affected by different factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. The German Shorthaired Pointer was developed to be a dog suited for family life, as well as a versatile hunter. Therefore, its temperament is that of an intelligent, bold, boisterous, eccentric, and characteristically affectionate dog that is cooperative and easily trained. This breed is smart, friendly, willing, and enthusiastic. The GSP is usually good with children, although care should be taken because the breed can be boisterous especially when young. These dogs love interaction with humans and are suitable pets for active families who will give them an outlet for their considerable energy.

This breed is smart, friendly, willing, and enthusiastic. The GSP is usually good with children, although care should be taken because the breed can be boisterous especially when young. These dogs love interaction with humans and are suitable pets for active families who will give them an outlet for their considerable energy. The German Shorthaired Pointer needs plenty of vigorous activity and thrives with much exercise and running. This need for exercise, coupled with the breed's natural instinct to hunt, means that training is an absolute necessity. The GSP's distinctly independent character means that any unused energy will likely result in the dog amusing itself, most probably in an undesirable manner. Most German Shorthaired Pointers make excellent watchdogs, as they are naturally a very vocal dog. The breed generally gets along well with other dogs, but a strong hunting instinct is normal for the breed, which is not always good for other small pets such as cats or rabbits.,Failure by the owner to give this active and intelligent dog sufficient exercise and/or proper training can produce a German Shorthaired Pointer that appears hyperactive or that has destructive tendencies. Thus, the breed is not a suitable pet for an inactive home or for inexperienced dog owners.  Although these dogs form very strong attachments with their owners, a bored GSP that receives insufficient exercise may feel compelled to exercise himself.  These dogs are athletic and can escape from four- to six-foot enclosures with little difficulty. Regular hunting, running, carting, bikejoring, skijoring, mushing, dog scootering or other vigorous activity can alleviate this desire to escape.,The German Shorthaired Pointer (GSP) is a medium to large sized breed of pointing dog developed in the 19th century in Germany for hunting. A versatile hunting breed, being an all-purpose gun dog suitable for both land and water, they are streamlined yet powerful with strong legs. While a hunting breed that retains a strong drive to find and chase game, they are extremely energetic and can excel at a wide variety of dog sports. Their demeanor when well-socialized is friendly toward both people and fellow canines, with some tendency to be \"velcro dogs\".,The German Shorthaired Pointer has a short coat that comes in various combinations, generally a mix of liver and white. They have moderately long floppy ears set high on the head. Longer, broad, and strong, muzzles allow retrieval of heavier game. The dog's profile should be straight or strongly Roman nosed; any dished appearance to the profile is incorrect according to breed standards. Their eyes are generally brown, with darker eyes being desirable; yellow or \"bird of prey\" eyes are a fault. The tail is commonly docked, although this is now prohibited in some countries. In competition they are penalized if the tail is curved either up or down while the dog is moving. When the GSP is in classic point stance, the tail should be held straight out from the body, forming a line with the pointing head and body. Like all German pointers, GSPs have webbed feet  and are known for going after waterfowl in the water.,The German Shorthaired Pointer is a member of the Sporting Group.

This allows the German Shorthaired Pointer to be an agile hunter with high performance in both field and water. The color can be a dark brown with some lighter brown colors, referred to as \"liver\" (incorrectly as \"chocolate\" or \"chestnut\"), black (although any area of black is cause for disqualification in American Kennel Club-sanctioned shows), white, liver roan, or liver and white. Commonly, the head is a solid or nearly solid color, and the body is speckled or \"ticked\" with liver and white, sometimes with large patches of solid color called \"saddles.\" Roan coats are also common, with or without patching. Solid liver and solid black coats also occur, often with a small blaze of ticking or white on the chest. While the German standard permits a slight sandy colouring (\"Gelber Brand\") at the extremities, this colouring is rare, and a dog displaying any yellow colouring is disqualified in AKC and CKC shows. The colouring of the GSP provides camouflage in the winter seasons. The coat can be very glossy if washed.,The GSP coat is easy to take care of, but they shed a lot. Although their coat is short, they do shed. They shed more at certain times throughout the year. If that isn't taken care of their hairs can be embedded in fabrics and carpet and it will be difficult to get it out.

A small amount of white is allowed on the chest. Although uncommon, red Gordons are occasionally born to normal-coloured parents, the result of expression of a recessive red gene. Predominantly tan, red, or buff dogs are ineligible for showing. A Gordon's coat is straight or slightly waved (but not curly), long and silky, with chest, stomach, ear, leg, and tail feathering. According to the AKC breed standard, \"the bearing is intelligent, noble, and dignified\". They are the heaviest of the setter breeds, with males reaching 27 inches (69 cm) at the withers and up to 80 pounds (36 kg) in weight.,The AKC describes the Gordon Setter temperament as \"alert, interested, and confident. He is fearless and willing, intelligent, and capable. He is loyal and affectionate, and strong-minded enough to stand the rigors of training\". Gordons are intensely loyal to their owners; thrive in an attentive, loving environment; and are good family dogs. Puppies and adult dogs can be quite boisterous, and although they are patient by nature, may not be suitable for households with very young children. Gordons are sensitive and empathic, eager to learn, and need firm but gentle handling. Early socialisation and obedience training is important. The breed is one of the slowest to mature, not hitting prime until three years of age or more, and will show puppy-like characteristics well into their older years.,Gordons were bred to run, and require 60 to 80 minutes of vigorous exercise daily. Young dogs should not be over-exercised or begin agility training until they are at least 18 months old, to avoid joint problems later in life. Because of their hunting instincts, Gordons should not be allowed to roam freely if unsupervised, as they are apt to wander into a potentially dangerous traffic situation while following a scent." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c490" }, "breed": "Grand Bleu de Gascogne", "origin": "France", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Bleu_de_Gascogne", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Grand_Bleu_de_Gascogne_in_a_blue_dogcollar.jpg/220px-Grand_Bleu_de_Gascogne_in_a_blue_dogcollar.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ec2" }, "breed": "Grand Bleu de Gascogne", "contenido": "The Grand Bleu de Gascogne is a breed of hounds of the scenthound type, originating in France and used for hunting in packs. Today's breed is the descendant of a very old type of large hunting dog, and is an important breed in the ancestry of many other hounds.,The  Grand Bleu de Gascogne is an imposing large dog, a typical hunting pack hound of the oldest type, with a lean and muscular body, long legs, slightly domed head, long drop ears, and drooping lips. Size is 65 to 72 cm (25.6 to 28.3 ins) at the withers, females slightly smaller. Dogs of this breed should show an attitude of calm strength and nobleness.The colour of the coat is white mottled with black, giving a slate blue overall appearance. There are black patches on either side of the head, with a white area on top of the head which has in it a small black oval. Tan \"eyebrow\" marks are over each eye. Faults are deviations in appearance that have an effect on the health and working ability of the dog, as well as an absence of expected features of colour, structure, and size, indicating that a dog with such faults should not be bred. Faults include aggression or fearfulness, anatomical malformation, and lack of type.Although these are large dogs, \"Grand\" does not necessarily refer to the size of the dogs. \"In most cases it is simply a label for a pack that is used for larger game\". Today. the breed is used in hunting boar, deer, and other game.,The Grand Bleu de Gascogne is a very large dog weighing 80-120 lbs,No unusual health problems or claims of extraordinary health have been documented for this breed. Temperament of individual dogs may vary.,The Grand Bleu de Gascogne ancestors were contemporaries with the St Hubert Hound and English Southern Hound, Comte de Foix kept a pack in the 14th century and Henry IV of France kept a pack in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.The Grand Bleu de Gascogne has a long history in the US, the first dogs were bred there in the 18th century; more Grand Bleus are now in the US than France. General Lafayette presented a pack of seven Grand Bleus to George Washington in 1785, who compared their melodious voices to the bells of Moscow.The Grand Bleu de Gascogne is noted for its focus on the hunt, as well as a good nose and distinctive, sonorous, deep howl, the breed is \"instinctively a pack hound\". In the past, it was used to hunt deer, wolves, and boar; in the field it is considered a rather slow and ponderous worker and today is predominantly used to hunt hares.The Grand Bleu de Gascogne has had a significant influence on the development of several breeds of scent hounds. After the French Revolution, it was used to revitalise the old Saintongeois, creating the Gascon Saintongeois, and the Bluetick Coonhound is considered a direct descendant of the Grand Bleu. The Grand Bleu de Gascogne was used by Sir John Buchanan-Jardine in the development of the Dumfriesshire Hound; in Britain, any native hounds with blue marbled coats are still referred to as 'Frenchies' after this breed." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c493" }, "breed": "Greenland Dog", "origin": "Greenland", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland_Dog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Greenland_Dog.jpg/220px-Greenland_Dog.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ec9" }, "breed": "Greenland Dog", "contenido": "The Greenland Dog (Greenlandic: Kalaallit Qimmiat, Danish: Gr\u00f8nlandshund) is a large breed of husky-type dog kept as a sled dog. They were brought from Siberia to North America by the Thule people 1,000 years ago, along with the Canadian Eskimo Dog. The Canadian Eskimo Dog is considered the same breed as the Greenland Dog since they have not yet diverged enough genetically to be considered separate breeds, despite their geographic isolation.Today the breed is considered as nationally and culturally important to Greenland and efforts are made to safeguard its purity. In western Greenland north of the Arctic Circle and entire eastern Greenland, it is illegal to import any dog from outside (except for police and assistance dogs with a special permit), and since 2017 all dogs have to be microchipped and registered in the Greenland dog database. In the southwest, such restrictions are not in place and the purity of dogs is not monitored. As the population has been falling (c. 15,000 in Greenland as of 2016), a number of projects have been initiated in an attempt of ensuring that Greenland's dog sledding culture, knowledge and use, along with the breed itself, are not lost.,An Esquimaux bitch was exhibited at one of the earliest dog shows held in Darlington, Britain on 29 July 1875, which was reported in the Live Stock Journal and Fanciers Gazette published on 6 August 1875. They were recognized by the Kennel Club at its foundation in 1880.The Greenland dog has been a draught animal in the Arctic regions for centuries and consequently they have developed a powerful body and heavy coats, with a natural capacity for load pulling and endurance in a harsh working environment. Roald Amundsen later used Greenland dogs to great success on his 1912 expedition to the Antarctic, where he became the first person to reach the South Pole. The men started with more dogs than they technically needed to pull the sledges, killing them along the way to use as food for dogs and men.,The first dogs arrived in the Americas 12,000 years ago. However, people and their dogs did not settle in the Arctic until the Paleo-Eskimo people 4,500 years ago and then the Thule people 1,000 years ago, both originating from Siberia. Dogs first appeared in Greenland around 4,000 years ago. The Inuit dogs from Canada (Canadian Eskimo Dog) and Greenland (Greenland Dog) descended from dogs associated with Thule people, who relied on them for transportation from Siberia. In 2015, a study using a number of genetic markers indicated that these were both the same dog and should not be treated as separate breeds, that they maintain an indigenous heritage that predates colonization and the timing corresponds with the arrival of the Thule people, and that they were distinct from Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Huskies and Malamutes. The maternal mitochondrial DNA sequences of the Inuit dogs were classified as haplotype A31 that indicates a common female ancestor, and this haplotype could not be found in other modern dogs but the nearest match was with a 1,000 year-old dog from Florida.Nearly all dog breed's genetic closeness to the gray wolf is due to admixture. However, several Arctic dog breeds show a genetic closeness with the now-extinct Taimyr wolf of North Asia due to admixture. These breeds are associated with high latitudes - the Siberian Husky and Greenland Dog that are also associated with Arctic human populations, and to a lesser extent the Shar Pei and Finnish Spitz. An admixture graph of the Greenland dog indicates a best-fit of 3.5% shared material, however an ancestry proportion ranging between 1.4% and 27.3% is consistent with the data. This indicates admixture between the Taymyr wolf population and the ancestral dog population of these 4 high-latitude breeds. This introgression could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment. It also indicates the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than one region.In 2020, a genetic study found that Greenland sled dogs have been kept isolated from other breeds since their arrival in Greenland with the Inuit people 850 years ago. Their lineage traces more genomic history than other arctic-breeds to their ancestor's remains which were found on Zhokhov Island, arctic northeastern Siberia and dated to be 9,500 years old." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c49c" }, "breed": "Hamiltonst\u00f6vare", "origin": "Sweden", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonst%C3%B6vare", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Hamiltonstovare_600.jpg/220px-Hamiltonstovare_600.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ed2" }, "breed": "Hamiltonst\u00f6vare", "contenido": "The Halden Hound (Norwegian: Haldenst\u00f8ver), is a medium-sized Norwegian dog breed of the  hound class, used for hunting hares and other plains quarry.

Other names for the breed include Ainu-ken, Seta, Ainu dog. In Japan, its name is sometimes shortened to D\u014d-ken (\u9053\u72ac). The Hokkaido is native to the prefecture of the same name in Japan.,The breed is medium in size, with small, triangular, upright ears. The small eyes have a rising triangular outline. The Hokkaido has a coat of long, stiff fur, and a second, shorter coat of soft fur. Colors include red, white, black, brindle, sesame, black and tan, and wolf-gray. Males are typically 50 cm (20 in) tall at the withers, females slightly shorter, with body masses in the 20 kg (44 lb) range. Dogs bred on continents outside of their native Japan may be smaller.,The breed is known for fidelity to its owner, bravery, and the ability to withstand the cold, among other traits. It has an innate sense of direction and smell, and can therefore return to its master no matter how great the distance. Temperament will vary depending on the lineage and region of upbringing. ,Traditionally in Japan, the dog has been used as a working breed that plays both the role of family pet and hunter. In Japan, they are strongly tied to hunting kennels and work alongside their handlers to manage populations of wild boar and bear. Their vocal nature manifests in varying types of characteristic howls, long and short barks, used as sighting signals on hunts. They have an unusual fighting style against the Hokkaido brown bear, or higuma, and will take risks to protect its master, despite size differences. The way in which the Ainu dog accomplishes this is to attack the bear's back, then bite and hold the dorsal flesh of the bear's neck until the bear retreats. For this purpose, the Hokkaido in Japan are encouraged to have a fierce and unrelenting character that benefits in the field.,Brought up as a family pet, Hokkaido may deviate from the more primal temperament exhibited with dogs in hunting kennels. The Hokkaido is highly intelligent and food motivated, a combination that results in positive responses to training. Hunting dogs are encouraged to be vocal, but a Hokkaido as a family pet may not necessarily exhibit such habits with training. As the Hokkaido has very little distribution throughout countries outside Japan, the Hokkaido's temperament solely as a family pet is still forming. Although the Hokkaido carries an innate prey drive, early socialization shows good behaviors with cats and other small animals considered to be part of its 'pack'.,The Hokkaido's play is different from other breeds, with a more crouch and prowl style of play that is often misunderstood as aggression. For this reason, Hokkaido are often considered to be leash-only animals. However, with its roots to hunting, they have excellent owner stickiness and work well with recall techniques.,They are good with children and other animals if they are raised with them from puppyhood and/or properly socialized. The Hokkaido needs moderate but regular exercise to stay in shape. It should be taken for long daily walks." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4a4" }, "breed": "Hygen Hound", "origin": "Norway", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygen_Hound", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Norwegian_Hygenhound.jpg/220px-Norwegian_Hygenhound.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5edd" }, "breed": "Hygen Hound", "contenido": "A Hygen Hound (Hygenhund) is a Norwegian breed of dog from the hound group, created in the 19th century by Norwegian breeder Hygen from various other hound breeds.

They can be so intelligent that they can become stubborn, which is considered an unwanted trait. They excel at agility, and even though they are small dogs, they are thick-boned and can withstand high jumps. Their small size can be advantageous to agility training, allowing them to move with ease and gracefulness.,They come in four colors: red and white; black and white; gray and white; and all white. There are subdivisions within each color, such as wolf gray and silver gray, cinnamon red and dark red, jet black and white, and salt and pepper black and white.

George Washington received French Foxhounds, Grand Bleu de Gascogne, (which look much like an American Bluetick Coonhound) as a gift from the Marquis de Lafayette. Many of the dogs Washington kept were descended from Brooke's, and when crossed with the French hounds, helped to create the present-day American Foxhound. The American Foxhound is known to have originated in the states of Maryland and Virginia, and is the state dog of Virginia.The breed was developed by landed gentry purely for the sport of hunting foxes. With the importation (or migration) of the red fox, Irish Foxhounds were added to the lines, to increase speed and stamina in the dog, qualities still prevalent in today's dogs. One quality that the American Foxhound is famous for is its musical bay that can be heard for miles. This is one reason why this breed does not do well in city settings.The breed was first recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1886. Today, there are many different strains of American Foxhound, including Walker, Calhoun, Goodman, Trigg, July and Penn-Marydel. Though each strain looks different, they are all recognized as members of the same breed. Most show hounds are Walkers, many of the pack hounds (used with hunting foxes on horseback) are Penn-Marydel and hunters use a variety of strains to suit their hunting style and quarry.,While standards call for the American Foxhound to be about 21\u201325 in (53\u201364 cm) tall to the withers, and weigh anywhere between 55\u201371 lb (25\u201332 kg), many of them are larger in structure (especially the show strains), with males standing 26\u201329 in (66\u201374 cm) and females 25\u201328 in (64\u201371 cm) and smaller in weight, typically between 45\u201365 lb (20\u201329 kg). The legs of a Foxhound are long and straight-boned. The foxhound's chest is rather narrow. It has a long muzzle, and a large, domed skull. The ears are wide and low-set. The eyes are hazel or brown, and are large and wide-set." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c40a" }, "breed": "Appenzeller Sennenhund", "origin": "Switzerland", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appenzeller_Sennenhund", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Dara_essy.jpg/220px-Dara_essy.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c653" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/appenzeller_sennenhund.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 3, "energy": 3, "barking": 4, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 15, "max_height_male": 22, "max_height_female": 22, "max_weight_male": 70, "max_weight_female": 70, "min_height_male": 19, "min_height_female": 19, "min_weight_male": 48, "min_weight_female": 48, "breed": "Appenzeller Sennenhund" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5df4" }, "breed": "Appenzeller Sennenhund", "contenido": "The Appenzeller Sennenhund is a medium-size breed of dog, one of the four regional breeds of Sennenhund-type dogs from the Swiss Alps.

It is a medium-sized dog and comes in a variety of colours. The Kelpie has been exported throughout the world and is used to muster livestock, primarily sheep, cattle and goats.,The breed has been separated into two distinct varieties: the Show (or Bench) Kelpie and the Working Kelpie. The Show Kelpie is seen at conformation dog shows in some countries and is selected for appearance rather than working instinct, while the Working Kelpie is bred for working ability rather than appearance.,The ancestors of most Kelpies were British dogs known loosely as collies (sometimes spelled colleys). These were mostly black, or very dark brown, dogs \u2013 hence the name collie, which has the same root as coal. (The official collie breeds were not formed until about 10 or 15 years after the Kelpie was established as a breed, and the first recognised Border Collie was not brought to Australia until after the Federation in 1901). Some collies were imported to Australia for stock work in the early 19th century, and were bred with other types of dogs \u2013 usually with an eye to working sheep without direct supervision.,For much of the 20th century and early 21st century it was claimed that kelpies were partly descended from dingoes. In 2019, it was widely reported that a genomic study conducted by researchers from the University of Sydney indicated that the kelpie had no dingo ancestry although this is still uncertain. Claire Wade, co-author of the study's paper, informed Bill Robinson (author of Origins of the Australian Kelpie) that she has never suggested there was \"no dingo blood in the Kelpie breed\" as the media reported. Wade explained: The genes studied in our analysis were specifically chosen because it is those aspects of Kelpies (the ears and the ginger/cream colours) that lead most everyday people to presume the relationship between Kelpie and dingo. The evidence of our study proves conclusively that, at least for those characteristics, there is no evidence for relationship to be found.,The first dog known as a Kelpie was a black and tan female pup with floppy ears bought by Jack Gleeson about 1872 from a litter born on Warrock Station near Casterton, owned by George Robertson, a Scot. This dog was named Kelpie after the kelpie, a mythological shapeshifting water spirit of Celtic folklore. In later years she was referred to as \"(Gleeson's) Kelpie\", to differentiate her from \"(King's) Kelpie\", her daughter.,The second \"Kelpie\" was \"(King's) Kelpie\", another black and tan bitch out of \"Kelpie\" by \"Caesar\", a pup from two sheepdogs imported from Scotland. \"(King's) Kelpie\" tied for the prestigious Forbes Trial in 1879, and the strain was soon popularly referred to as \"Kelpie's pups\", or just Kelpies. The King brothers joined another breeder, McLeod, to form a dog breeding partnership whose dogs dominated trials during 1900 to 1920.An early Kelpie, Sally, was mated to Moss, a Smooth Collie, and she produced a black pup that was named Barb after The Barb, a black horse which had won the Melbourne Cup in 1866. Consequently, black Kelpies became known as Barb Kelpies or Barbs.There were a number of Kelpies named Red Cloud. The first and most famous was John Quinn's Red Cloud in the early 20th century. In the 1960s, another Red Cloud became well known in Western Australia. This started the tradition in Western Australia of calling all Red or Red and Tan Kelpies, especially those with white chests, Red Cloud Kelpies. Other notable specimens include Gunner and Red Dog (c. 1971 \u2013 21 November 1979), a Kelpie mix which was the subject of a movie, Red Dog, released in 2011.,Kelpies have now been exported to many countries including Argentina, Canada, Italy, Korea, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States for various pursuits.,By 1990, Kelpies have been trained as scent dogs with good success rates.

While the Bakharwal Dog is mainly found in India, it is found in smaller numbers in Afghanistan and Pakistan.A recent study says that this breed is on the verge of extinction and Bakerwal community has appealed to include this animal in the endangered species category. Of late, there were many cases when this mountain breed of dog contracted rabies or was shot by separatist militants.,The origin of the Bakharwal Dog lies in Ladakh, northern India, and found  in the states of Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. It has been bred by the Gujjar and Bakerwal castes, as well as other local people of Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, for the purpose of guarding their flocks of goats, sheep and cattle, along with their houses, from centuries. The Bakharwal Dog may be descended from crossbreeding the Tibetan Mastiff with the Indian pariah dog, though other scholars state that the Bakharwal Dog is the \"oldest Indian Dog which since centuries has been surviving with the Gujjar tribe.\"The Bakharwal Dog has been targeted by separatist militants in the erstwhile Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, who shot the dogs to prevent them from alerting people of their intrusion.

Bakarwal is a powerful, heavy bone, medium to large size dog. It is an agile and a sturdy breed, a typical mountain dog with a furry coat and plumy tail that gives it a majestic look. It looks like a medium version of Tibetan Mastiff. It is mostly in black colour with white at toes and chest. The dog has a vegetarian appetite that mainly includes bread made of rice chaff, maize and milk. Common colours are black and tan, red, fawn, pied, sable, white and brindle.Bakarwal bitches produce a litter once in a year, with 3-4 pups.,The Bakharwal Dog, along with the Gaddi Kutta, is particularly used for guarding sheep, protecting farms and homes in Himachal Pradesh as well as in Jammu and Kashmir. It is also used by the Indian Police in order to capture militants across the nation.Bakharwal Dogs, the mountain dogs are an ancient breed of working dogs found in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Scientists believe that these may be amongst the oldest herding dogs having origins in Central Asia. They are bred by nomadic tribes as a livestock guardian dog and settlement protector. Bakharwal Dog puppies between 8 and twelve weeks old need four meals daily. Bakharwal Dog puppies 3 to 6 months old should be fed 3 meals in a 24-hour period. Top-quality dry dog food ensures balanced nutrition to adult bakharwal dogs and may be mixed with water, canned food.

While predominantly considered a single breed, it is bred in four distinct varieties based on coat type and colour; the long-haired black Groenendael, the rough-haired fawn Laekenois, the short-haired fawn Malinois, and the long-haired fawn Tervuren; in the United States the American Kennel Club considers the four varieties to be separate breeds.,The breed descends from a common type of shepherd dog found throughout Western Europe that includes such modern breeds as the Bouvier des Ardennes, Dutch Shepherd and German Shepherd. A common sight in the service of Belgian shepherds for centuries, it was not until the end of the 19th century that a breed club was formed and attempts were made to standardise the breed.,In addition to its historical role as a herding dog, Belgian Shepherds have been used as assistance dogs, companion dogs, detection dogs, guard dogs, guide dogs, police dogs, and search and rescue dogs. The breed has a long history of being used by military forces, serving in both World Wars; they continue to be used by a number of militaries in a variety of roles to this day.,The Belgian Shepherd is a medium-sized athletic breed with a body built for endurance, they typically stand between 56 and 66 centimetres (22 and 26 in) with bitches being on average 4 centimetres (1.6 in) shorter than dogs, they usually weigh between 20 and 30 kilograms (44 and 66 lb); the breed standard states the ideal height is 62 centimetres (24 in) for dogs and 58 centimetres (23 in) for bitches. The breed has a long, slender head with triangular, erect ears that are rounded at the base, and a long, narrow but balanced muzzle, according to the breed standard a dog that stands 62 centimetres at the withers should have a head that is 25 centimetres (9.8 in) long and a muzzle approximately half that length. The breed's body is muscular but not overly heavy; the body's length from shoulder to haunches is approximately the same as their height at the withers, proportionally slightly longer in bitches; they have a straight topline and their belly is neither low-slung nor overly high like that of a sighthound. The breed's chest is deep but not overly broad; their neck is muscular, widening at the shoulders with a slight arch at the nape; their tail is strong and of medium length and curves upwards slightly at the level of their knee; their forelegs are straight and well-boned, their hind legs are muscular and very powerful, none of the legs are overly heavy.The four varieties vary principally in their coat types and colours, the breed standard describes three coat varieties; long-haired, short-haired and rough-haired. Long-haired dogs have a long, smooth coat with short hair on their faces, ears and legs although there is long feathering on the rear of the legs, they have an abundant mane on their neck and chest, particularly long hair on the rear of their thighs and a bushy tail that forms a plume. Short-haired dogs have particularly short hair on the faces, ears and lower portion of their legs, short over the rest of the body and slightly longer on the neck and tail. Rough-haired dogs have a coat that is rough, dry and approximately 6 centimetres (2.4 in) long over the body, they have shorter hair on the top of the muzzle and legs and, unlike the other coat types, they have long hair on the face and muzzle.The Groenendael variety is long-haired, it has a solid black double coat, the outer coat is straight and particularly long around the shoulders, neck and chest; they have short hair on the face, and well feathered legs and tail.The Laekenois variety is rough-haired, its coat is fawn in colour with discreet black overlay and is harsh, dry and normally slightly tangled in appearance; it has a bristled, feathered muzzle and limited feathering on the legs and tail. According to the breed standard, black overlay means the tips of the hair are black but not in patches or stripes such as brindle.The Malinois variety is short-haired, it is fawn in colour with black overlay, with a charcoal-coloured face and extremities.The Tervuren variety is long-haired like the Groenendael; its double coat is typically fawn in colour with black overlay and with black extremities, although grey with black is known; it has a ruff of long hair around the neck and feathering on the legs.,Belgian Shepherds are known to be highly intelligent, alert and sensitive; they are typically highly trainable, vigilant and hard-working with a strong guarding instinct making them protective of property and family, and very well suited for service with security services. The Groenendael and Tervueren varieties have a reputation for occasionally being snappy, making them less suitable as companion dogs for children; the Laekenois, whilst considered very good with children, can occasionally be troublesome with other dogs. The Belgian Shepherd responds well to training and responds very well to firm and understanding training; they require training from an early age, particularly the Laekenois which can have a tendency to try to dominate a weaker-willed master. The breed is very active, particularly the Malinois which may reflect its continued breeding for security roles, and they all require exercise; the breed adapts well to living indoors, although the Malinois is least suited to these environs." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c425" }, "breed": "Berger Picard", "origin": "France", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berger_Picard", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Picard_Delice_Stacked.jpg/220px-Picard_Delice_Stacked.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c662" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/berger_picard.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 1, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 4, "trainability": 4, "energy": 4, "barking": 2, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 13, "max_height_male": 25.5, "max_height_female": 25.5, "max_weight_male": 70, "max_weight_female": 70, "min_height_male": 23.5, "min_height_female": 23.5, "min_weight_male": 50, "min_weight_female": 50, "breed": "Berger Picard" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e15" }, "breed": "Berger Picard", "contenido": "The Berger Picard (, French: [b\u025b\u0281\u0292e pika\u0281]) or Picardy Shepherd, is a French herding dog originating in Picardy.

Since they can be demonstrative to their owners and enthusiastic towards other animals, formal obedience training and positive socialization is important." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c427" }, "breed": "Black Norwegian Elkhound", "origin": "Norway", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Norwegian_Elkhound", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/BlackNorwegianElkhound.jpg/220px-BlackNorwegianElkhound.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e1a" }, "breed": "Black Norwegian Elkhound", "contenido": "The Black Norwegian Elkhound is a small Spitz breed classified by the FCI as a hunting dog. It is very rare outside the Nordic countries of Scandinavia. It is bred for the same purpose as the Grey Norwegian Elkhound but is smaller, more agile, and easier to recognize in the snow. Historically, it is a much \"younger\" breed, first bred in Norway during the 18th century. The breed name \"Elkhound\" comes directly from its original Norwegian name \"Elghund,\" meaning \"\"elk dog\" or \"moose dog.\" In Norwegian, \"elg\" refers to the animal English speakers know as an \"elk\" (in Eurasia) or \"moose\" (in the United States), and \"hund\" means \"dog.\",The Black Norwegian Elkhound is a typical Spitz breed with a short compact body, dark eyes, ears standing straight up, and a curly tail carried over the back. It has a rich coat that does not stand out from the body. This is an all-weather hunting dog and the coat is very important. It must be able to keep out the heavy autumn rain in Scandinavia and endure the cold weather, which it does very well.,It has a dense, short, thick, coarse, double coat and is solid black. A mature dog stands between 40 and 51 centimeters (16\"-20\") - 47 cm (+3/-4) for males and 44 cm (+3/-4) for females - and weighs between 16 kilograms (35 lb) and 20 kilograms (44 lb).,The Black Norwegian Elkhound is a very robust and hardy dog: very alert and full of power and pride. It is more strong-minded than the Grey Elkhound. The most recommended training method is one that focuses on motivating the dog; such as clicker training or reward-based training methods. Using punishment or dominance-based methods could negatively impact training with the Black Norwegian Elkhound. It is easy to train, but always needs something to do to be happy. It needs continuous exercise and activity in concert with its superb intelligence to do well. It is an excellent hunting dog and loves to be in the forest." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c429" }, "breed": "Black Mouth Cur", "origin": "United States", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mouth_Cur", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Black_mouth_cur-10.jpg/220px-Black_mouth_cur-10.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e19" }, "breed": "Black Mouth Cur", "contenido": "The Black Mouth Cur, also known as the Southern Cur, Southern Black Mouth Cur and the Yellow Black Mouth Cur, is a medium to large sized breed of cur-type dog from the United States.

There are a number of stories about the breed's ancestry, the most commonly held story is the breed descends from dogs brought to southern Mississippi by European settlers, among these progenitor European dogs included Belgian Malinoises. In this environment these dogs were bred into their current form as a popular cur-type hunting dog, and from Mississippi they spread to the mountains of Tennessee, Missouri and North Carolina and eventually into the Big Thicket region of Southeast Texas. It is claimed the title character in Fred Gipson's novel Old Yeller was a Black Mouth Cur. In 1987 a breed club was formed to support the breed, the Southern Black Mouth Cur Breeders Association, and in 1998 the breed was recognised by the United Kennel Club.,The Black Mouth Cur is a medium to large sized, athletic, muscular breed of dog. The breed varies considerably in height, typically standing between 16 and 25 inches (41 and 64 cm) with individual dogs known to reach 28 inches (71 cm), the breed standard mandates a minimum height of 18 inches (46 cm) for dogs and 16 inches for bitches. The breed typically weighs between 45 and 100 pounds (20 and 45 kg), with the breed standard allowing for significantly lighter animals than is typical, stating a minimum 40 pounds (18 kg) for mature dogs and 35 pounds (16 kg) for mature bitches.

This breed is large with a strong bone structure and well developed muscles. Its head appears blocky with a short length between the stop and nose. It carries itself with a confident and powerful movement, is fearless and shows courage when threatened.,The name Boerboel derives from the Afrikaans words boer which means farmer, and \"boel\" which is a shortening of \"boelhond\" which means bulldog.One historical source dated 1909 describes events in 1857, when a cross between a bulldog and a mastiff referred to as the \"Boer Hunting Dog\" was the best dog for hunting leopards and baboons in packs. A leopard that is caught in a trap by one leg can be killed by a pack of these dogs, but in one case a dog was badly injured. The \"Boer mastiff\" is described as an excellent fighter, with one managing to kill a leopard in each of four single combats over a number of years before being killed himself in the fifth encounter. However, the Boerboel is not a deterrent for a leopard, and a leopard will kill and carry away a large dog such as a Boerboel or a Rottweiler; a missing dog in South Africa may indicate that a leopard is in the area.In remote areas of South Africa the Boerboel was kept by the farming population to protect their families and property in their homes and on their farms.,In South Africa, the Animal Improvement Act (62 of 1998) defines a breed of animal indigenous to or developed in the republic to be a landrace, therefore the Boerboel is regarded as a landrace in the republic. The Act grants powers to a registered \"animal breeders society\", and the South African Boerboel Breeders' Society (SABBS) is a registered animal breeders society. The SABBS is the only organisation authorised under the Act to officially register Boerboels. As legally registered custodian of the Boerboel dog breed, SABBS is responsible for the standards that govern identification, recording, evaluation and improvement of the breed. The Kennel Union of South Africa still recognises those Boerboels registered on its books.,The Boerboel is a large dog, with a strong bone structure and well developed muscles. The head appears blocky, but not overdone, with a short length between the stop and nose. It should look impressive, carrying itself with confidence and powerful movement, which should be buoyant, and unencumbered, despite its size. It should be symmetrical and balanced, following the desired proportions for the breed.The coat is short and sleek with dense hair coverage. The recognised colours are brindle, fawn, and brown.

They are descended from landrace sheepdogs once found all over the British Isles, but became standardized in the Anglo-Scottish border region. Presently they are used primarily as working dogs to herd livestock, specifically sheep.The Border Collie is considered a highly intelligent, extremely energetic, acrobatic and athletic dog. They frequently compete with great success in sheepdog trials and a range of dog sports like dog obedience, disc dog, herding and dog agility. They are one of the most intelligent breed of all domestic dog breeds. Border Collies continue to be employed in their traditional work of herding livestock throughout the world and are kept as pets.,In general, Border Collies are medium-sized dogs with a moderate amount of coat, which is more often thick and prone to shedding. They have a double coat that varies from smooth to rough and is occasionally curled. While black and white is the most commonly seen color pattern of the Border Collie, the breed appears in just about any color and pattern known to occur in dogs. Some of these include black tricolor (black/tan/white), liver and white, and red tricolor (red/tan/white) which have also been seen regularly, and other colours such as blue, lilac, red merle, blue merle, brindle, and Australian red (also known as ee red, blonde, recessive red, or gold) which is seen less frequently. Some border collies may also have single-color coats.Eye color varies from brown to blue, and occasionally eyes of differing color occur; this is usually seen with merles. The ears of the border collie are also variable \u2014 some have fully erect ears, some fully dropped ears, and others semi-erect ears (similar to those of the rough collie). Although working border collie handlers sometimes have superstitions about the appearance of their dogs (handlers may avoid mostly white dogs due to the unfounded idea that sheep will not respect a white or almost all white dog), in general, the American Border Collie Association considers a dog's appearance to be irrelevant. Instead, it is considered more useful to identify a working border collie by its attitude and ability.,Dogs bred for show are more homogeneous in appearance than working border collies, since to win in conformation showing they must conform closely to breed club standards that are specific on many points of the structure, coat, and color. Kennel clubs specify, for example, that the border collie must have a \"keen and intelligent\" expression, and that the preferred eye color is dark brown. In deference to the dog's working origin, scars and broken teeth received in the line of duty are not to be counted against a border collie in the show ring. The males' height from withers comes from 48 to 56 centimetres (19 to 22 in), females from 46 to 53 centimetres (18 to 21 in).,Border Collies require considerably more daily physical exercise and mental stimulation than many other breeds. The border collie is widely considered to be the most intelligent dog breed. The border collie ranks 1st in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, being part of the top 10 brightest dogs. Although the primary role of the border collie is to herd livestock, the breed is becoming increasingly popular as a companion animal.,In this role, due to their working heritage, border collies are very demanding, playful, and energetic. They thrive best in households that can provide them with plenty of play and exercise, either with humans or other dogs. Due to their demanding personalities and need for mental stimulation and exercise, many border collies develop problematic behaviors in households that are not able to provide for their needs. They are infamous for chewing holes in walls and furniture, and destructive scraping and hole digging, due to boredom. Border collies may exhibit a strong desire to herd, a trait they may show with small children, cats, and other dogs. The breed's herding trait has been deliberately encouraged, as it was in the dogs from which the border collie was developed, by selective breeding for many generations. However, being eminently trainable, they can live amicably with other pets if given proper socialization training.,The American Border Collie Association recommends that potential owners, before taking on the breed as a household pet, should be sure they can provide regular exercise commensurate with the collie's high energy and prodigious stamina. A working collie may run many miles a day, using its experience, personality, and intelligence to control challenging livestock. These dogs will become distressed and frustrated if left in isolation, ignored or inactive. Like many working breeds, border collies can be motion-sensitive and may chase moving vehicles and bicycles, but this behavior can be modified by training. Some of the more difficult behaviors require patience, as they are developmental and may disappear as the dog matures." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c431" }, "breed": "Border Terrier", "origin": "United Kingdom", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Terrier", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Border_Terrier.jpg/220px-Border_Terrier.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c66a" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/border_terrier.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 2, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 4, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 4, "energy": 3, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 15, "max_height_male": 15, "max_height_female": 15, "max_weight_male": 15.5, "max_weight_female": 14, "min_height_male": 12, "min_height_female": 12, "min_weight_male": 13, "min_weight_female": 11.5, "breed": "Border Terrier" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e27" }, "breed": "Border Terrier", "contenido": "The Border Terrier is a British breed of small, rough-coated terrier.

The dogs were traditionally used in fox-hunting, and worked with the Border Hunt in Northumberland.,The breed was officially recognised by The Kennel Club in Great Britain in 1920, and by the American Kennel Club in 1930.,Originally the Border Terrier was referred to as the Coquetdale Terrier or Redesdale Terrier from the area in which it evolved, but by the late 1800s it was generally known as the Border Terrier, probably because of its long history with the Border Hunt in Northumberland. It shares its ancestry with that of the Bedlington Terrier and the Dandie Dinmont Terrier. It was recognised as a breed by the Kennel Club in 1920, the same year The Border Terrier Club was formed. Their original purpose was to bolt foxes which had gone to ground. They were also used to kill rodents, but they have been used to hunt otters and badgers too.,The first Kennel Club Border Terrier ever registered was The Moss Trooper, a dog sired by Jacob Robson's Chip in 1912 and registered in the Kennel Club's Any Other Variety listing in 1913. The Border Terrier was rejected for formal Kennel Club recognition in 1914, but won its slot in 1920, with the first standard being written by Jacob Robson and John Dodd. Jasper Dodd was made first President of the Club.,In 2006, the Border Terrier ranked 81st in number of registrations by the AKC, while it ranked tenth in the United Kingdom.In 2008, the Border Terrier ranked eighth in number of registrations by the UK Kennel Club.,The Border Terrier was bred to have long enough legs to keep up with the horses and other foxhounds, which travelled with them, and small enough bodies to crawl in the burrows of foxes and chase them out so the hunters had a blank shot. The foxhounds that travelled with them were not small enough to do the Border Terrier's job.Border Terriers have a broad skull and moderately short muzzle, and strong teeth. The V-shaped ears are on the sides of the head and fall towards the cheeks. Common coat colours are grizzle-and-tan, blue-and-tan, red, or wheaten. Whiskers are few and short.

It is the state dog of South Carolina, where it was discovered and further developed by hunters in the 1900s. 1 September,1984 is Boykin Spaniel Day in South Carolina.,The Boykin Spaniel is only slightly larger than the English Cocker Spaniel but much heavier through the body width. Height at the withers for males ranges from 15.5\u201317 in (39\u201343 cm) and weight 30\u201340 lb (14\u201318 kg). Females are smaller, 14\u201316.5 in (36\u201342 cm) and 25\u201335 lb (11\u201316 kg). Buyers should be aware of the size and weight in the puppy's pedigree before choosing a breeder if size is a factor in their choice of dog. Traditionally, its tail is docked at the age of three days, leaving 1/3 length. Eyes are engaging and bright. The color ranges from brilliant gold to a dark amber. Puppies will have milky bluish-gold to amber eyes until a few months old. The coat color comes in liver or chocolate (shades of brown).,Coat length and density vary widely due to the variety of breeds that make up the recent background of this breed. The coat is flat to moderately curly with medium length, fine hair with light feathering acceptable on the legs, feet, ears, chest, and belly. Length is normally 1-2 inches throughout the body. A few bloodlines throw shorter, straight coats much like a Labrador Retriever. Feathering on the ears, chest, through the tuck-up and along the legs can be very little to moderate in density and length. Feathering may take on a sun-bleached golden to tawny color especially on the ears and should not be penalized. Groomed dogs should have a minimal of stripping or clipping, with slight shaping around the head and topline. Some individuals have a topknot like a Llewellin Setter. Field types are often shaved down and should not be penalized as long as it is of appropriate length to protect the skin. Improper shaving will result in some coats growing back in with excessive discoloration, fading or graying. White markings other than a mark on the chest, or a white mark on the chest that is more than 60% of the width of the chest, disqualify puppies from being registered with the Boykin Spaniel Society, although the American Kennel Club and United Kennel Club do not allow denial of registration for conformation reasons. White on the toes or chest is purely a cosmetic trait and will not affect the ability or health of the dog.,The Boykin Spaniel is a versatile hunter, working as a retriever and upland hunter, flushing birds into flight. Pointing is not in character with the Boykin's hunting style, but many confuse the inherent characteristic of a \"hesitant flush\" with pointing. Of the six or eight different breeds used to create the current breed, three are pointing breeds for this reason. The field Boykin spaniel wants to be 100% precise when she flushes her bird, and as a dutiful partner she knows to wait until her hunter is positioned for the shot. Their stamina in hot weather and eagerness make them good for dove hunts, but also for pheasant and other upland game. They can be used in driving deer or in tracking wounded game. Their small size makes them easy to carry in a canoe or other small boat, and they are described as \"the dog that doesn't rock the boat.\"  However, an unacceptably high percentage of Boykin spaniels are not able to internally produce the proteins necessary to keep their muscles working during sustained work in warm temperatures, and can be fatal. As of 2017, Exercise Induced Collapse syndrome appears in about 10% of all Boykin spaniels due to inattentive breeding practices. Screening for the presence of the gene which causes EIC is done by simple DNA sample collection and analysis.  Prospective buyers of Boykin spaniel puppies are advised to obtain verified proof of DNA testing from all breeders before buying.,The Boykin Spaniel is a friendly, social dog that is considered a good family pet. It is easily trained and eager to work. It is good with, and extremely stable around children and other dogs. They can sometimes be described as energetic with great endurance. They are extremely adaptable to different environments as long as they are given ample opportunity for social interaction and plenty of time to burn off excess energy reserves. They are not easily angered and tend to be eager to please and friendly, but they love attention." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c43c" }, "breed": "Bull Terrier", "origin": "England", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_Terrier", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Bullterrier-3453301920.jpg/220px-Bullterrier-3453301920.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c672" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/bull_terrier.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 1, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 4, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 3, "energy": 4, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 13, "max_height_male": 22, "max_height_female": 22, "max_weight_male": 70, "max_weight_female": 70, "min_height_male": 21, "min_height_female": 21, "min_weight_male": 50, "min_weight_female": 50, "breed": "Bull Terrier" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e3e" }, "breed": "Bull Terrier", "contenido": "The Bull Terrier is a breed of dog in the terrier family.

Other names include qimmiq or qimmit (Inuit language word for \"dog\").  The Greenland Dog is considered the same breed as the Canadian Eskimo Dog since they have not yet diverged enough genetically to be considered separate breeds, despite their geographic isolation.The breed is threatened with extinction, with a 2008 estimate of only 300 purebred dogs. Although once used as the preferred method of transportation by Inuit in the Canadian Arctic, by the 1960s traditional working dog teams became increasingly rare in the North. Contributing factors to the breed's decline include the increasing popularity of snowmobiles for transportation and the spread of infectious canine diseases. Controversy surrounds the intentional killings of a debated number of Inuit sled dogs between 1950 and 1970 by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as well as recent efforts to increase the breed's population.,The first dogs arrived in the Americas 12,000 years ago. However, people and their dogs did not settle in the Arctic until the arrival of two groups from Siberia, the Paleo-Eskimo people 4,500 years ago and the Thule people 1,000 years ago. The Inuit dogs from Canada (Canadian Eskimo Dog) and Greenland (Greenland Dog) descended from dogs associated with the Thule people, who relied on them for transportation from Siberia.,In 2015, a study using a number of genetic markers indicated that these were both the same dog and should not be treated as separate breeds, that they maintain an indigenous heritage that predates colonization and the timing of which corresponds with the arrival of the Thule people, and that they were distinct from Siberian Huskies, Alaskan huskies and Alaskan Malamutes. The maternal mitochondrial DNA sequences of the Inuit dogs were classified as haplotype A31 that indicates a common female ancestor. This haplotype could not be found in other modern dogs; the nearest match was with the 1,000 year\u2013old  remains of a dog from Florida.However, a 2018 study found that all of the indigenous North American dogs were now extinct, with their nearest genetic relatives being the Arctic dog breeds.,The Canadian Eskimo Dog should always be powerfully built, athletic, and imposing in appearance. It should be of \"powerful physique giving the impression that he is not built for speed but rather for hard work.\" As is typical of spitz breeds, it has erect, triangular ears, and a heavily feathered tail that is carried over its back. Males should be distinctly more masculine than females, who are finer boned, smaller, and often have a slightly shorter coat.,Its superficial similarity to wolves was often noted by explorers during the Coppermine Expedition of 1819\u20131822. They noted that the ears of the Eskimo dogs they encountered were similar to those of American wolves, and their forelegs lacked the black mark above the wrist characteristic of European wolves. The most sure way to distinguish the two species was said to be through the length and posture of the tail, which was shorter and more curved in the dog." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c445" }, "breed": "Cane di Oropa", "origin": null, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cane_di_Oropa", "img": "Not available", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e4f" }, "breed": "Cane di Oropa", "contenido": "Sixteen Italian dog breeds are recognised by the Ente Nazionale della Cinofilia Italiana and by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale; a seventeenth is partially recognised.

It is a native breed which has historically lived on farms in the eastern part of Denmark and southernmost part of Sweden (i.e. on both sides of \u00d8resund, the narrow strait that separates the Danish island of Zealand from the southern tip of the Scandinavian peninsula), serving as a guard dog, rat catcher and hunting dog. The breed's soft and gentle temperament also makes them excellent companion dogs.,There are some indications that the breed originates from the pinscher breeds and the British white hunting terriers.,The Danish\u2013Swedish Farmdog became a recognized breed in Denmark and Sweden in 1987.  At that time, the two countries got together and agreed on the name of the breed, and also on the breed standard written by judge and breeder Lars Adeheimer, Sweden and judge Ole Staunskjaer, Denmark. The DSF was used as a farm dog for many hundreds of years, and before becoming a recognized breed it was known under the local name \"Skrabba\", \"Sk\u00e5neterrier\", \"r\u00e5ttehund\", \"rat dog\").,The FCI standard says that a DSF should be 30\u201339 cm of height with a compact body. The relation between withers height and body length should be 9 to 10. The head is rather small and triangular with a well-emphasized stop. The coat is hard, short and smooth in texture, with white as a dominating colour, with one or several patches of different colour combination. The tail could be long, half bobtail or bobtail.,The Danish\u2013Swedish Farmdog is a very friendly, easygoing breed.

Its taxonomic classification is debated as indicated by the variety of scientific names presently applied in different publications. It is variously considered a form of domestic dog not warranting recognition as a subspecies, a subspecies of dog or wolf, or a full species in its own right.,The dingo is a medium-sized canine that possesses a lean, hardy body adapted for speed, agility, and stamina. The dingo's three main coat colourations are light ginger or tan, black and tan, or creamy white. The skull is wedge-shaped and appears large in proportion to the body. The dingo is closely related to the New Guinea singing dog, or the New Guinea Highland wild dog: their lineage split early from the lineage that led to today's domestic dogs, and can be traced back through the Malay Archipelago to Asia.The earliest known dingo fossil, found in Western Australia, dates to 3,450 years ago. However, genomic analysis indicates that the dingo reached Australia 8,300 years ago but the human population which brought them remains unknown. Dingo morphology has not changed over the past 3,500 years: this suggests that no artificial selection has been applied over this period.The dingo's habitat covers most of Australia, but they are absent in the southeast and Tasmania, and an area in the southwest (see map). As Australia's largest extant terrestrial predators, dingoes prey on mammals up to the size of the large red kangaroo, in addition to birds, reptiles, fish, crabs, frogs, insects, and seeds. The dingo's competitors include the native quoll, the introduced European red fox and the feral cat. A dingo pack usually consists of a mated pair, their offspring from the current year, and sometimes offspring from the previous year.The first British colonists who settled at Port Jackson in 1788 recorded dingoes living with indigenous Australians, and later at Melville Island in 1818, and the lower Darling and Murray rivers in 1862, indicating that dingoes were under some form of domestication by aboriginal Australians. When livestock farming began expanding across Australia in the early 19th century, dingoes began preying on sheep and cattle. Numerous population-control measures have been implemented since then, with only limited success. The dingo is recognised as a native animal under the laws of all Australian jurisdictions.,The dingo plays a prominent role in the Dreamtime stories of indigenous Australians; however, it rarely appears depicted in their cave paintings when compared with the extinct thylacine, also known as the Tasmanian wolf or Tasmanian tiger.,The name \"dingo\" comes from the Dharug language used by the Indigenous Australians of the Sydney area. ,The first British colonists to arrive in Australia in 1788 established a settlement at Port Jackson and noted \"dingoes\" living with indigenous Australians. The name was first recorded in 1789 by Watkin Tench in his Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay:,The only domestic animal they have is the dog, which in their language is called Dingo, and a good deal resembles the fox dog of England. These animals are equally shy of us, and attached to the natives. One of them is now in the possession of the Governor, and tolerably well reconciled to his new master.,The variants include \"tin-go\" for a bitch, \"din-go\" for a dog, and \"wo-ri-gal\" for a big dog. The dingo has different names in different indigenous Australian languages, such as boolomo, dwer-da, joogoong, kal, kurpany, maliki, mirigung, noggum, papa-inura, and wantibirri. Some authors propose that a difference existed between camp dingoes and wild dingoes as they had different names among indigenous tribes. The people of the Yarralin, Northern Territory region frequently call those dingoes that live with them walaku, and those that live in the wilderness ngurakin. They also use the name walaku to refer to both dingoes and dogs. The colonial settlers of New South Wales wrote using the name dingo only for camp dogs. It is proposed that in New South Wales the camp dingoes only became wild after the collapse of Aboriginal society." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c468" }, "breed": "Drentse Patrijshond", "origin": "Netherlands", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drentse_Patrijshond", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Drentse_Patrijshond.jpg/220px-Drentse_Patrijshond.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e8c" }, "breed": "Drentse Patrijshond", "contenido": "The Drentsche Patrijshond is a versatile spaniel-type hunting dog from the Dutch province of Drenthe. Called the Dutch Partridge Dog (or \"Drent\" for Drenthe) in English, approximately 5,000 dogs are registered with the breed club in the Netherlands, and breed clubs operate in Belgium, Denmark, Scandinavia and North America. The Drentsche Patrijshond bears some resemblance to both spaniel and setter types of dog. An excellent pointer and retriever, this dog is often used to hunt fowl and adapts equally well to the field or marshes.,Valid color is white with brown or orange markings. Mostly white with large brown plates (spots). There is usually one plate that covers the backside above the tail. A mantle (large marking across the back) is permissible, but generally less desired.  The coat is medium long, with feathers on the leg and longer hair on the front of the chest, giving the impression of a longer-haired coat. The Drentsche Patrijshond is 55 to 63 cm (22 to 25 in). at the withers. The breed weighs 48-73 pounds on average.,The origins of the Drentsche Patrijshond are in the 16th century, from the Spioenen (or Spanjoelen) which came to the Netherlands through France from Spain, and is related to the Small M\u00fcnsterl\u00e4nder of Germany and the Epagneul Fran\u00e7ais of France. In the Netherlands, these dogs were called partridge dogs. ,The presence of the partridge dogs had been visible for centuries, as in the 17th-century painting The Hunter's Present, c. 1658\u201360, by Gabriel Metsu. In the painting, the partridge dog leans against the hunter's knee, as the man is handing a woman a partridge, which was a double entendre at the time. The dog in The Hunter's Present is a very large, stocky dog that could possibly pull a cart; showing the range of the early type, a much smaller, lighter dog of the same type is shown in another painting by the same artist, The Poultry seller, 1662. This painting also involves a woman being offered a bird, regarded with suspicion by her dog.,Before formal recognition as a modern breed in 1943, the type had been kept separate from other dogs as an undocumented breed for centuries in the rural province of Drenthe. As the Drentsche Patrijshond is a breed developed in the Netherlands, the breed standard was first developed and approved in 1943 by the Raad van Beheer op Kynologisch Gebied (Dutch Kennel Club), the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale national kennel club for the Netherlands. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale recognised the breed using the standard developed by the breed's country of origin as the standard to be used in international competition. The United Kennel Club in the United States also recognises the breed using the outdated (February 1994) F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale standard. ,In November 2010, the AKC recognized the Drentsche Patrijshond Club of North America (DPCNA) and the Drentsche Patrijshond was added to the AKC Foundation Stock Service Program, allowing owners of registered Drents to participate in AKC sanctioned events such as hunt tests and agility competitions, starting in 2011." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c469" }, "breed": "Dunker", "origin": "Norway", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunker", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Dunker.jpg/220px-Dunker.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e8f" }, "breed": "Dunker", "contenido": "A Dunker, also known as the Norwegian Hound, is a medium-sized breed of dog from Norway.

Its skull is slightly domed with a defined stop and clean cheeks, the muzzle is long and square-cut with a straight and broad nasal bridge, and its teeth are evenly spaced with a scissors bite. The Dunker has a black nose with wide nostrils, round, large, and dark eyes, and low-set, wide, flat, ears that hang close to the head and to the middle of the muzzle.The Dunker has a long neck with no throatiness, sloping shoulders, straight forelegs, a level topline, a straight and strong back with broad and muscular loins, and a slight tuck up in the chest. Its hindquarters are well-angulated, as are its stifle, and its thighs and hocks are broad. The feet are arched, well-knit, have firm pads and hair between the toes, and point straight ahead. The tail is set on level with the topline, strong at the root, tapering at the end, straight, carried in a slight upward curve, and reaches to the hock.The Dunker's coat is straight, hard, dense, and not too short, with the most desirable colors being black or blue marbled with pale fawn and white markings. Less desirable are warm brown or predominant black reaching from the muzzle and beyond the hock joint, a black mask, and overmarked white, and more than fifty percent white color is a disqualification.The Dunker weighs around 35\u201339 pounds (16\u201318 kg), and males are 19.5\u201321.5 inches (50\u201355 cm) at the withers, while females are 18.5\u201320.5 inches (47\u201352 cm).,The breed is named after the Norwegian Wilhelm Dunker, who bred this dog for hunting hares at the beginning of the 19th century.

It was selectively bred from the German Shepherd to create a larger dog with better resistance to cold conditions, and was intended for military and guard work.,The East European Shepherd was bred in the Soviet Union in the early twentieth century. In the 1920s a number of German Shepherds were imported from Germany into the Ukrainian SSR, where a breeding programme was established with the aim of adapting the breed to the harsher Soviet climatic conditions. Over several decades of selective breeding, a distinctly different form of shepherd had been created from that known in the West; from 1950 this was named the Vostochno Evropeiskaya or East European. While initially the breed was centred in Ukraine, it soon spread throughout the Soviet Union, although its fortunes suffered during the Great Patriotic War. At the end of the War there were substantial imports of German Shepherd dogs from Germany; importation had not been possible before the War.The East European Shepherd was used heavily by the military and police within the Soviet Union as a guard and sniffer dog. It was a favourite of the KGB, who only ever kept solid black examples; if a single non-black pup was born in a litter bred by the KGB the entire litter was destroyed and that breeding was not repeated. A breed standard was approved in 1955 by the Central Committee of the USSR DOSAAF, and in 1964 by the Presidium of the Service Dog Breeding Federation. The East European Shepherd is now among the most numerous dog breeds in Russia and several former Soviet countries.With effect from 1 January 2017 the Vostochno Evropeiskaya Ovcharka was recognised by the Nordic Kennel Union, and is thus recognised by the Danish Kennel Club, the Finnish Kennel Club, the Icelandic Kennel Club, the Norwegian Kennel Club and the Swedish Kennel Club.,The East European Shepherd is significantly larger than the German Shepherd and shows substantial sexual dimorphism: dogs typically stand 67 to 72 cm (26 to 28 in) at the withers although some can be as tall as 74 cm (29 in); bitches are typically 62 to 67 cm (24 to 26 in). The coat is dense and of medium length, with a well-developed undercoat, and often with longer soft hair on the ears, neck, limbs and tail. It may be black-and-tan, sable or solid black; brindles or whites are rare. The eyes may be brown, amber or blue; odd-coloured eyes are known. The ears are long and upright, and the paws are large with long toes, giving a snowshoe-like appearance.The breed is considered particularly intelligent, courageous, determined and tough, and owners often describe its temperament as similar to that of a Dobermann." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c46e" }, "breed": "English Foxhound", "origin": "Great Britain - England", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Foxhound", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/English_Foxhound_portrait.jpg/220px-English_Foxhound_portrait.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c68b" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/english_foxhound.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 5, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 1, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 4, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 4, "energy": 4, "barking": 5, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 13, "max_height_male": 24, "max_height_female": 24, "max_weight_male": 75, "max_weight_female": 75, "min_height_male": 24, "min_height_female": 24, "min_weight_male": 60, "min_weight_female": 60, "breed": "English Foxhound" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e96" }, "breed": "English Foxhound", "contenido": "The English Foxhound is one of the four foxhound breeds of dog.

It is an affectionate, excitable breed with a typical lifespan of twelve to fourteen years. They are very similar to the Welsh Springer Spaniel and are descended from the Norfolk or Shropshire Spaniels of the mid-19th century; the breed has diverged into separate show and working lines. The breed suffers from average health complaints. The show-bred version of the breed has been linked to \"rage syndrome\", although the disorder is very rare. It is closely related to the Welsh Springer Spaniel and very closely to the English Cocker Spaniel; less than a century ago, springers and cockers would come from the same litter. The smaller \"cockers\" hunted woodcock while the larger littermates were used to flush, or \"spring\", game. In 1902, The Kennel Club recognized the English Springer Spaniel as a distinct breed. They are used as sniffer dogs on a widespread basis. The term Springer comes from the historic hunting role, where the dog would flush (spring) birds into the air.  ,The English Springer Spaniel is a medium-sized compact dog. Its coat is moderately long with feathering on the legs and tail. It is a well proportioned, balanced dog with a gentle expression and a friendly wagging tail. This breed represents perhaps the greatest divergence between working and show lines of any breed of dog. A field-bred dog and a show-bred dog appear to be different breeds but are registered together. The gene pools are almost completely segregated and have been for at least 70 years. A field-bred dog would not be competitive in a modern dog show, while a show dog would not have the speed or stamina to succeed in a field trial.The English Springer Spaniel field-bred dogs tend to have shorter, coarser coats than show-bred dogs. The ears are less pendulous. Field-bred dogs are wiry and have more of a feral look than those bred for showing. The tail of the field-bred dog may be docked a few inches in comparison to the show dog.  Field-bred dogs are selected for their sense of smell, hunting ability, and response to training rather than appearance.Show dogs have longer fur and more pendant ears, dewlaps and dangling flews. The tail is docked to a short stub in those countries that permit docking. They are generally more thickly boned and heavier than field-bred springers.The English Springer Spaniel is similar to the English Cocker Spaniel and at first glance, the only major difference is the latter's smaller size. However English Springers also tend to have shorter, and higher-set ears than English Cockers. Springers also tend to have a longer muzzle; their eyes are not as prominent, and the coat is less abundant. The major differences between the Welsh Springer and the English Springer are that the Welsh have more limited colors and tend to be slightly smaller.,Field-bred dogs tend to have shorter, coarser coats than the longer furred show-bred dogs. They normally only shed in summer and spring months but shed occasionally in the autumn. The coat comes in black or liver (dark brown) with white markings or predominantly white with black or liver markings; Tricolour: black and white or liver and white with tan markings, usually found on eyebrows, cheeks, inside of ears and under the tail. Any white portion of the coat may be flecked with ticking.,Males in the show dog line are typically approximately 19 to 21 inches (48 to 53 cm) at the withers and weigh 40 to 60 lb (18 to 27 kg). According to the UK Breed Standard, the English Springer Spaniel should be 20 inches (51 cm) at the withers. The females should be 18 to 20 inches (46 to 51 cm) and usually 35 to 55 lb (16 to 25 kg).

Its original game hunting purpose was to point to game that fled into trees, such as grouse, and capercaillies, but it also serves well for hunting elk. Some individuals have even been known to go after a bear. In its native country, the breed is still mostly used as a hunting dog.

However, several Arctic dog breeds show a genetic closeness with the now-extinct Taymyr wolf of North Asia due to admixture. These breeds are associated with high latitudes - the Siberian husky and Greenland dog that are also associated with arctic human populations, and to a lesser extent the Shar Pei and the Karelo-Finnish Laika. An admixture graph of the Greenland dog indicates a best-fit of 3.5% shared material, however an ancestry proportion ranging between 1.4% and 27.3% is consistent with the data. This indicates admixture between the Taymyr wolf population and the ancestral dog population of these 4 high-latitude breeds. This introgression could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment. It also indicates the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than one region.,It is assumed that the Finnish Spitz developed from Spitz-type dogs that came from central Russia with migrants 3,000 years ago.  These small clans of woodsmen relied on their dogs to help them obtain food, and the excellent hunting ability of the Finnish Spitz made it a favorite choice.By 1880, as advanced means of transportation brought diverse peoples and their dogs together, Finnish Spitzes mated with other breeds of dogs, and were becoming extinct as a distinct breed.  At about that time, a Finnish sportsman from Helsinki named Hugo Roos observed the pure native Finnish Spitz while hunting in the northern forests.  He realized the many virtues of the pure Finnish Spitz breed and decided to select dogs that were untainted examples of the genuine Finnish Spitz in order to try to revive the breed.  Thirty years of careful breeding resulted in the modern Finnish Spitz; the dogs are descendants of his original foundation stock.Finnish Kennel Club has revised the breed standard six times, and the latest version was confirmed in 1996. In 1979, when the club celebrated its 90th anniversary, the Finnish Spitz was declared Finland's national dog breed. The club  is also working for including the hunting experience with the Finnish Spitz on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List.,The proper conformation is a square build, meaning that the length of the body is the same or slightly shorter than the height of the withers to the ground.  The length of the body is measured from the point of the shoulder or forechest in front of the withers to the rump.  Females are usually a little longer in the back than males.  Both sexes should appear slightly longer in the leg than the back.,Dew claws can appear on front and/or back feet.  If back claws appear, they should be removed.  The front dewclaws can be removed, if desired." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c47e" }, "breed": "Garafian Shepherd", "origin": "Canary Islands (Spain)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garafian_Shepherd", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Ch-Rasti.jpg/250px-Ch-Rasti.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5eac" }, "breed": "Garafian Shepherd", "contenido": "The Pastor Garafiano is a Spanish breed of sheep dog native to the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands. The name comes from the comarca of Garaf\u00eda, in the north of the island, where the breed was most common, although specimens can be found throughout the island. The breed was officially recognized by the Real Sociedad Canina de Espa\u00f1a in 2003.,This is a distinct canine population, it is a native to the comarca of Garaf\u00eda, on the island of La Palma, where it was used by shepherds to bring the herds of goats. Because of this, the animal thrives well in steep and rocky areas. It has very heterogeneous characteristics, because there has only been performed a functional selection. Its core competency is the grazing of goats and sheep in rugged terrain, by the geography of La Palma. Its origin lies the pre-Hispanic times, although the crossings with other races (most importantly the Belgian shepherds) after the conquest contributed to the development of the Pastor Garafiano.,For a time, this breed was on the verge of disappearing due to out-breeding with other dog breeds. Successive crosses, especially from 1960s with other breeds of shepherd dogs, demonstrated the necessity to work for its recovery and selection from the few pure specimens of the race that kept the shepherds of the island. To avoid the disappearance of the dog breed the working group to recovery of the Pastor garafiano was created, which became the Spanish association of the Pastor Garafiano Dog. Among the objectives of the association are the censuses, the creation of breeding centers, the participation in dog shows and fairs, etc.,The breed has been brought in samples of indigenous breeds that have been held in the Canary Islands, as well as international exhibitions held in Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas. The Department of Ethnology of the School of Veterinary of the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria has conducted several studies on the breed, which were presented at the symposium of indigenous breeds held in C\u00f3rdoba in March 1992.,Lupoid, medium proportions or moderately rangy, well balanced, medium to large.

The first representatives of the breed appeared in the north-east of the country. The species originates from  Tibetan Mastiff and was used for the multiple daily tasks. The Nagazi accompanied shepherds, helping them to take care of the herds. Their main task was to chase away wolves and bears from the sheep. Georgian Shepherd were also used as guard dogs to protect property. There is a legend that one Nagazi tore a wolf to pieces while protecting younger member of the family.,For a long period of time breeders were not interested in creating a separate breed and continuing the selection process of the Georgian shepherd, the number of Nagazi gradually decreased. The breed was on the verge of extinction. In 2000, the Cynological Federation of Georgia officially adopted a unified breed standard. The description includes distinct breed features and accepted variations. Today, a community of breed enthusiasts  is working on the development of the Nagazi, and this herding dog is gradually gaining popularity outside Georgia.,There are two kinds of Georgian livestock guardian dogs: the short haired \"Lion\" type, typically pure white or white with dark patches on its coat and the long hair \"Bear\" type are typically dark brown to black head and lighter brown covering the rest of the coat. In Georgia they are known as Qartuli Nagazi. The short hair \"Lion\" type is considered to the oldest or Aboriginal variant of the breed, with the pure white being the rarest coat color. The \"Lion\" variant was predominantly found in the north-east regions of Georgia.,Physically, these dogs are strongly-boned, muscular, and athletic, with a large head and powerful legs. The shape of the head of the Georgian mountain dog is almost rectangular, proportional in size to the body. The skull is flat, oblong and deep, the forehead is flat, the occipital protuberance is developed, but hidden behind developed muscles. Superciliary arches are moderate. The nose is wide black or brown with well developed nostrils. The muzzle is wide, shorter than the skull. The neck should be short and powerful.The Georgian Shepherd Dog is distinguished by a massive large build, moderately stretched format. The musculature is well-developed, without relief.The teeth are white, set close together without gaps. A scissor bite is recognized as normal for this breed, slight deviations are acceptable.,The ears are traditionally cropped. The eyes are of medium size, oval and set deep. Usually dark, but for dogs with white ears and light colors, light shades are acceptable. The Nagazi has a muscular withers, which are well defined and raised above the topline. A straight and wide back with short and powerful loin. The croup is rounded, close to horizontal in position. The ribcage is wide and slightly rounded.

It is a distinct and separate breed from the Affenpinscher, the Austrian Pinscher and the Miniature Pinscher or Zwergpinscher.,The origins of the German Pinscher are unknown. Dogs of this type, both rough-haired and smooth-haired, were traditionally kept as carriage dogs or as stable dogs, and so were sometimes known as Stallpinscher; they were capable ratters. Both types were known as Deutscher Pinscher, and came from the same lineage; rough-haired and smooth-haired puppies could occur in the same litter. The rough-haired Pinscher, which would later become the Standard Schnauzer, was also known as the Rattler.:\u200a152\u200aThe \"smooth Pinscher\" is mentioned by Heinrich Gottlieb Ludwig Reichenbach in 1836. In 1880 the Pinscher was recorded in the Deutschen Hundestammbuch of the Verein zur Veredelung der Hunderassen. In 1895 Ludwig Beckmann described five varieties of Pinscher \u2013 the rough- and smooth-haired Pinscher, the rough- and smooth-haired Miniature Pinscher, and the Affenpinscher; of the smooth-haired Pinscher he says that it is becoming less common, and is not often seen at dog shows. In 1895 a breed society, the Pinscher-Schnauzer-Klub, was established for both types, both rough- and smooth-haired.The Pinscher almost disappeared in the years after the Second World War. It was reconstructed by Werner Jung from a single standard-sized animal and four unusually large Miniature Pinschers. After eight years in which no births were recorded, a litter was whelped in 1958. The Pinscher was definitively accepted by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 1955.The Deutscher Pinscher is an endangered breed. In 2003 it was, with the Gro\u00dfspitz and the Mittelspitz, the 'endangered breed of the year' of the Gesellschaft zur Erhaltung alter und gef\u00e4hrdeter Haustierrassen; there were at that time 40 breeding bitches. In 2022 it was listed in category III, gef\u00e4hrdet ('endangered'), of the Rote Liste of that organisation. In each of the ten years from 2008 to 2017 the number of puppies whelped was between 350 and 450; in 2016 and 2017 there were just over 50 litters per year.,The German Pinscher is of medium size, with weights for both dogs and bitches in the range 14\u201320 kg and a height at the withers between 45 and 50 cm.

It is the largest of the three breeds of Schnauzer\u2014the other two breeds being the Standard Schnauzer and the Miniature Schnauzer. Numerous breeds were used in its development, including the black Great Dane, the Bouvier des Flandres, and the German Pinscher. Originally bred to assist on farms by driving livestock to market and guarding the farmer's property, the breed eventually moved into the city, where it worked guarding breweries, butchers' shops, stockyards and factories. It was unknown outside of Bavaria until it became popular as a military dog during World War I and World War II.,They have a dense coarse coat that protects them from the weather and from vermin. Giant Schnauzers come in three color varieties: pepper and salt, pure black with black undercoat, and black and silver. Where legal, they are shown with cropped ears and docked tails. Like other schnauzers, they have a distinct beard and eyebrows. Today, the Giant Schnauzer participates in numerous dog sports, including Schutzhund. Another sport that the dog excels in is that of nosework. Due to its alert nature, the dog is also used in police work.,The first Giant Schnauzers emerged from Swabia in the German state of Bavaria, and W\u00fcrttemberg in the 17th century. These original Giant Schnauzers were considered a rough-coated version of the German Pinscher breeds, and their hair was thought to help them withstand the harsh German winters and bites from vermin. The origins of the breed are unclear, but sources speculate it originated through some combination of black Great Danes, German Shepherds, Rottweilers, Dobermanns, Boxers, Bouvier des Flandres, Thuringian Shepherds, and the Standard Schnauzer.The Giant Schnauzer was originally bred as a multipurpose farm dog for guarding property and driving animals to market. By the turn of the 20th century the Giant Schnauzer was being used as a watchdog at factories, breweries, butcheries, and stockyards throughout Bavaria. It was unknown outside Bavaria until it was used as a military dog in World War I and World War II. The first Giant Schnauzers were imported to America in the 1930s, but they remained rare until the 1960s, when the breed became popular. In 1962, there were 23 new Giant Schnauzers registered with the American Kennel Club; in 1974 this number was 386; in 1984 it was over 800 and in 1987 it was around 1000 animals. In 2012, there were 94 new dogs registered, down from 95 in 2011.In modern times, the Giant Schnauzer is used as a police dog; is trained for obedience, dog agility, herding, search and rescue, and schutzhund; and is shown in conformation shows. They are also used for carting. In Europe, the breed is considered to be more of a working dog than a show dog. The focus in many European Schnauzer clubs is not so much on conformation shows, but on the working ability of the breed. In several countries, including Germany, dogs must achieve a Schutzhund Champion title before they can qualify to be a conformation champion.,Although the Giant Schnauzer is called 'Giant', this is not in comparison to other large dog breeds such as the Great Dane or the Rottweiler, but instead in comparison to the Standard and Miniature Schnauzers. The AKC breed standard calls for males to stand from 65 to 70 centimetres (25.5 to 27.5 in) at the withers, and for females to stand from 60 to 65 centimetres (23.5 to 25.5 in). Giant Schnauzers are square in shape, and should resemble a larger version of the Standard Schnauzer. The tail is long and the ears are small button ears carried high on the head. Where it is legal, it is possibly docked and the ears cropped.The head is 1\u20442 the length of the dog's back, when the back is measured from the withers to the base of the tail. The cheeks are flat, but well muscled. The coat is dense, wiry, and weather resistant. The fur on the Giant Schnauzer's face forms a distinct \"beard\" and eyebrows. Its stride is long and crisp." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c48a" }, "breed": "Golden Retriever", "origin": "Scotland", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Retriever", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Golden_Retriever_Dukedestiny01_drvd.jpg/220px-Golden_Retriever_Dukedestiny01_drvd.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c69a" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/golden_retriever.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 5, "shedding": 4, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 5, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 5, "energy": 3, "barking": 1, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 12, "max_height_male": 24, "max_height_female": 24, "max_weight_male": 75, "max_weight_female": 65, "min_height_male": 23, "min_height_female": 23, "min_weight_male": 65, "min_weight_female": 55, "breed": "Golden Retriever" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ebb" }, "breed": "Golden Retriever", "contenido": "The Golden Retriever is a British breed of retriever dog of medium size. It is characterised by a gentle and affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most frequently registered breeds in several Western countries. It is a frequent competitor in dog shows and obedience trials; it is also used as a gundog, and may be trained for use as a guide dog.,The breed was created by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate Guisachan in the late nineteenth century. He cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with some further infusions of Red Setter, Labrador Retriever and Bloodhound. The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1913, and during the interwar period spread to many parts of the world.,The Golden Retriever was developed in Scotland in the nineteenth century by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks (later to become Baron Tweedmouth) from Flat-coated Retrievers judiciously crossed with Tweed Water Spaniels and some other British dog breeds. Prior to the 1952 publication of the very detailed stud book which had been meticulously maintained by Marjoribanks, a number of romantic tales were published about the origins of the breed.In the 1860s Marjoribanks set out to create what to his mind was the ultimate breed of retriever at his Scottish estate Guisachan. He started by acquiring a yellow-coloured Flat-coated Retriever dog called Nous; Nous had been whelped in June 1864 and was the only yellow pup in an otherwise all black-coloured litter. Whilst uncommon, occasionally liver, brown, golden or yellow-coloured purebred Flat-coated Retriever pups are whelped to matings of two black parents. It is the pedigree of Nous that was the source for the romantic tales of the heritage of the Golden Retriever. One early account claimed Nous was purchased from a Russian circus trainer in Brighton, another claimed he was bought from a cobbler, and yet another claimed a gypsy. The stud book states that Nous was a Flat-coated Retriever bred by Lord Chichester on his Stanmer Park estate near Brighton.In 1868 Nous was mated to a Tweed Water Spaniel bitch named Belle, who is recorded in the stud book as being whelped in 1863 and being of \"Ladykirk breeding\". The litter from this mating consisted of four yellow pups, Primrose, Ada, Cowslip and Crocus. The best bitch from this litter, Cowslip, was mated to a Tweed Water Spaniel called Tweed with the mating producing a bitch pup called Topsy. Cowslip was subsequently mated to a Red Setter called Sampson, that mating produced a dog pup called Jack. Topsy was mated with a black Flat-coated Retriever called Sambo and a bitch pup from that litter, Zoe, was mated back to Jack and two pups from that mating were retained, a dog called Nous II and a bitch called Gill. Gill was mated to a black Labrador Retriever called Tracer, and a bitch pup from that mating, Queenie, was mated back to Nous II; all Golden Retrievers descend from this mating. The progeny from these various matings varied in colour from pure black to light cream, but it was the golden coloured ones that were retained and mated to each other, forming the foundation stock of the Golden Retriever breed. Marjoribanks is also known to have used a sandy-coloured Bloodhound and another Labrador in subsequent years of the breeding program.,In 1952 Marjoribanks's great-nephew, Giles Fox-Strangways, 6th Earl of Ilchester, teamed up with Elma Stonex and together they studied Marjoribanks's stud book. In 1960 their research was published, presenting all of the evidence required to counter all tales of Russian ancestry. The stud book, which covers the period from 1868 to 1890, is preserved in the library of the Kennel Club in London.,In the early days Golden Retrievers were called the 'Flat-coated Retriever, Golden', initially the Golden Retriever was considered a colour variety of the former breed. In 1903 the Kennel Club recorded the first examples, listing them in the same register as Flat-coats. In 1904 a Golden Retriever won a field trial and in 1908 the first examples were exhibited at conformation shows. In 1911 a breed club was formed for the breed in England, the Golden Retriever Club, and they were given a new name, the 'Yellow or Golden Retriever'; from this point they were increasingly seen as a separate breed from the Flat-coated Retriever. It was not until 1913 that the Kennel Club began recording them on a separate breed register from the Flat-coated Retriever and in 1920 the 'Yellow or' was dropped from the breed name and they were officially called the 'Golden Retriever'.One early twentieth century enthusiast of the breed, Winifred Charlesworth, was instrumental in the establishment of the breed club as well as its separate Kennel Club recognition. It was she who drew up the first breed standard, which was adopted by the Kennel Club and with only minor amendments and remains largely unchanged. She bred and exhibited the first Golden Retriever Show Champion, was a strong advocate for maintaining the working instincts of the breed, and she is credited with popularising it at field trials and introducing it to shooting sportsmen.In the years after the First World War its popularity increased markedly and in the 1920s and 1930s it spread through much of the Western world. The Canadian Kennel Club recognised the breed in 1927, the American Kennel Club in 1932; the first examples were registered in France in 1934 and Australia in 1937. The worldwide popularity of the breed meant it did not suffer the misfortunes many British dog breeds did during the Second World War due to British wartime restrictions on the breeding of larger dogs, with ample quality breeding stock available globally to ensure none of its characteristics were lost.Since the 1940s its popularity has continued to grow, and it has become one of the most recognised and most frequently registered dog breeds in the Western world." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c48b" }, "breed": "Go\u0144czy Polski", "origin": "Poland", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go%C5%84czy_Polski", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/PolishScenthound-%22NUTKA_Klusujaca_Sfora_wl_A.Balcerzak.jpg/220px-PolishScenthound-%22NUTKA_Klusujaca_Sfora_wl_A.Balcerzak.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ebd" }, "breed": "Go\u0144czy Polski", "contenido": "The Golden Retriever is a British breed of retriever dog of medium size. It is characterised by a gentle and affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most frequently registered breeds in several Western countries. It is a frequent competitor in dog shows and obedience trials; it is also used as a gundog, and may be trained for use as a guide dog.,The breed was created by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate Guisachan in the late nineteenth century. He cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with some further infusions of Red Setter, Labrador Retriever and Bloodhound. The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1913, and during the interwar period spread to many parts of the world.,The Golden Retriever was developed in Scotland in the nineteenth century by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks (later to become Baron Tweedmouth) from Flat-coated Retrievers judiciously crossed with Tweed Water Spaniels and some other British dog breeds. Prior to the 1952 publication of the very detailed stud book which had been meticulously maintained by Marjoribanks, a number of romantic tales were published about the origins of the breed.In the 1860s Marjoribanks set out to create what to his mind was the ultimate breed of retriever at his Scottish estate Guisachan. He started by acquiring a yellow-coloured Flat-coated Retriever dog called Nous; Nous had been whelped in June 1864 and was the only yellow pup in an otherwise all black-coloured litter. Whilst uncommon, occasionally liver, brown, golden or yellow-coloured purebred Flat-coated Retriever pups are whelped to matings of two black parents. It is the pedigree of Nous that was the source for the romantic tales of the heritage of the Golden Retriever. One early account claimed Nous was purchased from a Russian circus trainer in Brighton, another claimed he was bought from a cobbler, and yet another claimed a gypsy. The stud book states that Nous was a Flat-coated Retriever bred by Lord Chichester on his Stanmer Park estate near Brighton.In 1868 Nous was mated to a Tweed Water Spaniel bitch named Belle, who is recorded in the stud book as being whelped in 1863 and being of \"Ladykirk breeding\". The litter from this mating consisted of four yellow pups, Primrose, Ada, Cowslip and Crocus. The best bitch from this litter, Cowslip, was mated to a Tweed Water Spaniel called Tweed with the mating producing a bitch pup called Topsy. Cowslip was subsequently mated to a Red Setter called Sampson, that mating produced a dog pup called Jack. Topsy was mated with a black Flat-coated Retriever called Sambo and a bitch pup from that litter, Zoe, was mated back to Jack and two pups from that mating were retained, a dog called Nous II and a bitch called Gill. Gill was mated to a black Labrador Retriever called Tracer, and a bitch pup from that mating, Queenie, was mated back to Nous II; all Golden Retrievers descend from this mating. The progeny from these various matings varied in colour from pure black to light cream, but it was the golden coloured ones that were retained and mated to each other, forming the foundation stock of the Golden Retriever breed. Marjoribanks is also known to have used a sandy-coloured Bloodhound and another Labrador in subsequent years of the breeding program.,In 1952 Marjoribanks's great-nephew, Giles Fox-Strangways, 6th Earl of Ilchester, teamed up with Elma Stonex and together they studied Marjoribanks's stud book.

The Great Dane descends from hunting dogs from the Middle Ages used to hunt wild boar and wolves, and as guardians of the German nobility. It is one of the largest breeds in the world along with its relative, the Irish Wolfhound.,In the middle of the 16th century, the nobility in many countries of Europe imported strong, long-legged dogs from England, which were descended from crossbreeds between English Mastiffs and Irish Wolfhounds. They were dog hybrids in different sizes and phenotypes with no formal breed. These dogs were called Englische Docke or Englische Tocke \u2013 later written and spelled: Dogge \u2013 or Englischer Hund in Germany. The name simply meant \"English dog\". Since then, the English word \"dog\" has come to be associated with a molossoid dog in Germany and France. These dogs were bred in the courts of German nobility, independent of the English methods, since the start of the 17th century.The dogs were used for hunting bear, boar, and deer at princely courts, with the favorites staying at night in the bedchambers of their lords. These Kammerhunde (chamber dogs) were outfitted with ornate collars, and helped protect the sleeping princes from assassins.While hunting boar or bears, the Englische Dogge was a catch dog used after the other hunting dogs to seize the bear or boar and hold it in place until the huntsman was able to kill it. When the hunting customs changed, particularly because of the use of firearms, many of the involved dog types disappeared. The Englische Dogge became rare, and was kept only as a dog of hobby or luxury.,In Austria and Germany the Molossian hound, the Suliot dog and other imports from Greece were used in the 18th century to increase the stature of the boarhounds.,In 1878, a committee was formed in Berlin which changed the name of the \"Englische Dogge\" (English mastiff derivatives) to \"Deutsche Dogge\" (German mastiff), this being the Great Dane. This laid the foundations from which the breed was developed. During the 19th century, the dog was known as a \"German boarhound\" in English-speaking countries. Some German breeders tried to introduce the names \"German Dogge\" and \"German Mastiff\" on the English market, because they believed the breed should be marketed as a dog of luxury and not as a working dog. However, due to the increasing tensions between Germany and other countries, the dog later became referred to as a \"Great Dane\", after the grand danois in Buffon's Histoire naturelle, g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et particuli\u00e8re in 1755." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c494" }, "breed": "Greyhound", "origin": "(Widespread)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greyhound", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/GraceTheGreyhound.jpg/220px-GraceTheGreyhound.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c69e" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/greyhound.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 4, "shedding": 2, "grooming": 1, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 3, "energy": 4, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 13, "max_height_male": 30, "max_height_female": 30, "max_weight_male": 70, "max_weight_female": 65, "min_height_male": 28, "min_height_female": 28, "min_weight_male": 65, "min_weight_female": 60, "breed": "Greyhound" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5eca" }, "breed": "Greyhound", "contenido": "The English Greyhound, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing game and greyhound racing. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.,Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, \"S-shaped\" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.,The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph). The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) within 30 metres (98 ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66 ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820 ft) of a race.,Males are usually 71 to 76 centimetres (28 to 30 in) tall at the withers, and weigh on average 27 to 40 kilograms (60 to 88 lb). Females tend to be smaller, with shoulder heights ranging from 66 to 71 centimetres (26 to 28 in) and weights from 25 to 34 kilograms (55 to 75 lb), although weights can be above and below these average weights. Greyhounds have very short fur, which is easy to maintain. There are approximately 30 recognized color forms, of which variations of white, brindle, fawn, black, red, and blue (gray) can appear uniquely or in combination. Greyhounds are dolichocephalic, with a skull which is relatively long in comparison to its breadth, and an elongated muzzle.,Greyhounds are considered to make good pets, and are known for their loving nature and enjoyment of the company of humans or other dogs, though how well a Greyhound tolerates the company of other small animals such as cats depends on the individual dog's personality. Greyhounds will typically chase small animals; those lacking a high 'prey drive' will be able to coexist happily with toy dog breeds and cats.Greyhounds live most happily as pets in quiet environments. They do well in families with children, as long as the children are taught to treat the dog properly with politeness and appropriate respect. Greyhounds have a sensitive nature, and gentle commands work best as training methods.Occasionally, a Greyhound may bark; however, they are generally not barkers, which is beneficial in suburban environments, and they are usually as friendly to strangers as they are with their own families. A 2008 University of Pennsylvania study found that Greyhounds are one of the least aggressive dog breeds towards strangers, owners, and other dogs.A common misconception regarding Greyhounds is that they are hyperactive. This is usually not the case with retired racing Greyhounds. Greyhounds can live comfortably as apartment dogs, as they do not require much space and sleep almost 18 hours per day. Due to their calm temperament, Greyhounds can make better \"apartment dogs\" than smaller, more active breeds.,Many Greyhound adoption groups recommend that owners keep their Greyhounds on a leash whenever outdoors, except in fully enclosed areas. This is due to their prey-drive, their speed, and the assertion that Greyhounds have no road sense. In some jurisdictions, it is illegal for Greyhounds to be allowed off-leash, even in off-leash dog parks. Due to their size and strength, adoption groups recommend that fences be between 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 m) tall, to prevent Greyhounds from jumping over them. As per most breeds being rehomed, Greyhounds that are adopted after racing tend to need time to adjust to their new lives with a human family. Many guides and books have been published to aid Greyhound owners in helping their pet get comfortable in their new home." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c496" }, "breed": "Griffon Fauve de Bretagne", "origin": "France", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffon_Fauve_de_Bretagne", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/08115500_Griffon_Fauve_Bretagne.jpg/220px-08115500_Griffon_Fauve_Bretagne.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ecc" }, "breed": "Griffon Fauve de Bretagne", "contenido": "The Griffon Fauve de Bretagne (English: Fawn Brittany Griffon) is a breed of dog of the scenthound type, originating in France in the region of Brittany.,The Griffon Fauve de Bretagne is a medium-sized dog, 48 to 56 cm (19-22 ins, same for males and females) at the withers, with a distinctive rough (shaggy) pale coat, long drop ears, and a long tail carried up and in a slight curve.

Colours are fawn very slightly overlaid with black (poil de li\u00e8vre, hare coat), sable overlaid with black (gris loup, wolf grey), and fawn overlaid with blue (gris bleu, grey blue). There may be a small white spot on the chest.,The Griffon Nivernais was a breed kept by French noblemen which disappeared after the French Revolution. The breed was reconstructed beginning in 1925, by some hunters in Morvan, modeling on the ancient types that came to Europe with the Crusaders and the type called \"Canes Segusii\" or the Celtic Hound by early dog writers. The original dogs were used to hunt wolves and wild boar in the fourteenth century, and were much larger than the modern-day breed. The reconstruction of the breed was done based on the Grand Griffon Vend\u00e9en. Other breeds used were the Otterhound and Foxhounds.

The Blanquito descended from the also now-extinct Bich\u00f3n Tenerife. It is believed that the Blanquito was eventually cross-bred with other bichon types, including the poodle, to create what is now known as the Havanese. Sometimes referred to as \"Havana Silk Dogs\", this was originally another name for the Blanquito de la Habana.,The Havanese is small in size and sturdy in structure with a tail carried over its back and ears that drop and fold. The coat is abundant, long, and silky, and comes in all colors. The Havanese has a spirited personality and a curious disposition, and is notable for its springy gait, a characteristic that distinguishes the breed from all others. The Havanese is considered an ideal family pet and a true companion dog. They are highly adaptable to almost any environment. Because of their strong social needs, Havanese will not thrive in an environment where they are isolated for several hours each day.,Though it is a toy dog, Havanese are sturdy and not overly delicate. Most are 10 to 16 lb (4.5 to 7.3 kg) and 8+1\u20442 to 11+1\u20442 in (22 to 29 cm), with the ideal being 9 to 10+1\u20442 in (23 to 27 cm) at the withers. The body, measured from point of shoulder to point of buttocks, is slightly longer than the height at the withers, giving the dog the appearance of being slightly longer than tall. The length of the body results from the long ribcage, not the loins.,A unique aspect of the breed is the topline, which rises just slightly from withers to croup, creating a topline that is straight but not level. Renowned for their flashy, lively gait, their strong rear drive and slightly shorter upper arm produce a springy motion rather than a far-reaching one. The angle of the topline does not change while moving at a natural gait.,The muzzle is full and tapers slightly at the nose. It does not have the appearance of being short or snipy. Length of skull measured from stop to point of occiput is equal to the length of muzzle. The top of the skull is rather flat and the back skull is rounded.,The length from foot to elbow is equal to the length from elbow to withers. The fore chest is pronounced. When in a standing position, the sternum lines up with the elbows, creating a deep chest. Ribs are well-sprung and the abdomen is moderately tucked up.The Havanese has dark brown eyes and almond-shaped lids surrounded by black pigment. The ears, when extended, reach half way to the nose. They arc slightly upward at the base and hang down on the sides of the head without touching the face. The tail is carried arched forward up over the back. While the tail's long plume of hair falls on the body, the tail itself never touches the back." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4a6" }, "breed": "Indian pariah dog", "origin": "Indian subcontinent", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_pariah_dog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/The_Indian_Pariah_Dog.jpg/220px-The_Indian_Pariah_Dog.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ee2" }, "breed": "Indian pariah dog", "contenido": "The Indian pariah dog, also known as  the Indian native dog or INDog, South Asian pye dog and Desi Dog, is a landrace of dog native to the Indian subcontinent. They have erect ears, a wedge-shaped head, and a curved tail. It is easily trainable and often used as a guard dog and police dog. This dog is an example of an ancient group of dogs known as pye-dogs. It is possible that the ancestry of this dog dates back 4,500 years.Though most street dogs in the Indian subcontinent are in fact Indian pye-dogs, the names for this breed are often erroneously used to refer to all urban South Asian stray dogs despite the fact that some free-ranging dogs in the Indian subcontinent do not match the \"pariah type\" and may not be pure indigenous dogs but mixed breeds, especially around locations where European colonists historically settled in India, due to admixtures with European dog breeds.,It is a medium-sized dog of square to slightly rectangular build and short coat. The dog has a double coat, a coarse upper coat, and a soft undercoat. The most commonly observed colours are browns, ranging from dark to reddish-brown, with or without white markings. Solid blacks are rare, but some dogs are pied. Shaded coats, brindles, solid white and dalmatian-type spotting are never seen in pure populations. These may be a sign of mixing with modern breeds, as they are only seen in dogs in cities and other sites where non-native dogs have been introduced.The head is medium-sized and wedge-shaped. The muzzle is pointed and is of equal or slightly greater length than the head. The neck is noble and the forequarters are erect. Hindquarters are minimally angled. The trot is short. The eyes are almond-shaped and dark brown in colour. The ears are held erect and are pointed at the tips, with a broad base, set low on the head, and the tail is curled and held high when excited.,The namesake of this breed was given during the British Raj in India after the Pariah tribe of the Madras Presidency. From the Anglo-Indian word pye or pa\u00eb and Hindi p\u0101h\u012b meaning 'outsider', the Indian pariah dog is sometimes referred to as the pye-dog (also spelt pie or pi) and the Indian native dog. It is popularly known as Desi Kutta or Desi Dog (which derives from the Hindi-Urdu word desi, meaning native), as well as the Indi-dog or In-dog (in various spellings). It was referred to in the works of Rudyard Kipling as the \"yellow pariah dog\".,The pariah dog of India is an ancient autochthonous landrace that is found all over India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and even beyond South Asia. A pariah-like dog skull was discovered in the ancient Indian site of Mohenjo-daro and prehistoric rock art depicting a dog of similar type has been found in the Bhimbetka rock shelters. It was featured on National Geographic Channel's film, Search for the First Dog along with the other ancient types such as the Canaan Dog of Israel and the Australian dingo.The Indian pye-dog was introduced to the Andaman Islands with the establishment of a penal colony there, dogs having been previously unknown to the native Andamanese.Despite the Indian pariah dog being highly intelligent and easily trainable, the breed was intentionally downplayed during the British Raj by merchants who wished to sell their foreign breeds within the country. Their popularity in the West in recent years, however, has resulted in hundreds of dogs being exported out of the Indian subcontinent.In 2015, a breed standard was published in the Indian Kennel Gazette, the publication of Kennel Club of India, and the dog has been recognized by the Primitive and Aboriginal Dog Society (PADS), a worldwide grouping of enthusiasts based in the US.Some in the society view these dogs as a risk citing their increasing population in India in recent years. They consider these dogs as menace and nuisance owing to constant barking and biting people. Nevertheless, most of these attacks are caused due to human provocation like hitting them with sticks or throwing stones at them. The numbers of dog bites and deaths due to dog attacks are increasing every year. Since these dogs are largely not vaccinated, they frequently carry rabies.Indian Pariah dogs make for loving family pets and are great with kids and adults. They are high on energy and complement kids with an active lifestyle. Indian pariah dogs are one of the oldest dog breeds in existence today.

The breed is selectively bred for its unique features in the cold mountains of Afghanistan. Its local name is T\u0101\u017e\u012b Spay (Pashto: \u062a\u0627\u0698\u064a \u0633\u067e\u06cc) or Sag-e T\u0101z\u012b (Dari: \u0633\u06af \u062a\u0627\u0632\u06cc). Other names for this breed are T\u0101z\u012b, Balkh Hound, Baluchi Hound, Barakzai Hound, Shalgar Hound, Kabul Hound, Galanday Hound or sometimes incorrectly African Hound. They have the ability to run and turn well.,The Afghan Hound has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century. It is most closely related to the Saluki.,Connections with other types and breeds from the same area may provide clues to the history. A name for a desert coursing Afghan hound, Tazi (Sag-e-Tazi), suggests a shared ancestry with the very similar Tasy breed from the Caspian Sea area of Russia and Turkmenistan. Other types or breeds of similar appearance are the Taigan from the mountainous Tian Shan region on the Chinese border of Afghanistan, and the Barakzay, or Kurram Valley Hound.There are at least 13 types known in Afghanistan, and some are being developed (through breeding and record keeping) into modern purebred breeds.Once out of Afghanistan, the history of the Afghan Hound breed became entwined with that of the very earliest dog shows and the Kennel Club (UK). Various sighthounds were brought to England in the 1800s by army officers returning from British India (which at the time included), Afghanistan, and Persia, and were exhibited at dog shows, which were then just becoming popular, under various names, such as Barukzy hounds. They were also called \"Persian Greyhounds\" by the English, in reference to their own indigenous sighthound.,One dog in particular, Zardin, was brought in 1907 from India by Captain Bariff, and became the early ideal of breed type for what was still called the Persian Greyhound. Zardin was the basis of the writing of the first breed standard in 1912, but breeding of the dogs was stopped by World War I.,Out of the longhaired sighthound types known in Afghanistan, two main strains make up the modern Afghan Hound breed. The first were a group of hounds brought to Scotland from Balochistan by Major and Mrs. G. Bell-Murray and Miss Jean C. Manson in 1920, and are called the Bell-Murray strain. These dogs were of the lowland or steppe type, and are less heavily coated.,The second strain was a group of dogs from a kennel in Kabul owned by Mrs. Mary Amps, which she shipped to England in 1925. She and her husband came to Kabul after the Afghan war in 1919, and the foundation sire of her kennel (named Ghazni) in Kabul was a dog that closely resembled Zardin. Her Ghazni strain were the more heavily coated mountain type. Most of the Afghans in the United States were developed from the Ghazni strain from England. The first Afghans in Australia were imported from the United States in 1934, also of the Ghazni strain. The French breed club was formed in 1939 (FALAPA). The mountain and steppe strains became mixed into the modern Afghan Hound breed, and a new standard was written in 1948, which is still used today.,The Afghan Hound can also come with a much more \"patterned\" coat. This descends from the Bell-Murray's and the Ghazni lines, and is displayed in much lighter feathering of coat, deeper saddle (often actually looking like a saddle) and much shorter hair on the face and neck. It is believed that these particular Afghan Hounds were a product of much hotter parts of the country.The beauty of Afghan Hound dogs caused them to become highly desirable show dogs and pets, and they are recognised by all of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world. One of the Amps Ghazni, Sirdar, won BIS at Crufts in 1928 and 1930. An Afghan hound was featured on the cover of Life Magazine, November 26, 1945. Afghan Hounds were the most popular in Australia in the 1970s, and won most of the major shows. An Afghan Hound won BIS (Best in Show) at the 1996 World Dog Show in Budapest. Afghan hounds were BIS at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1957 and again in 1983. That win also marked the most recent win at Westminster for breeder-owner-handler, Chris Terrell.The Afghan Hound breed is no longer used for hunting, although it can be seen in the sport of lure coursing." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c3f3" }, "breed": "Affenpinscher", "origin": "Germany", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affenpinscher", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Affenpinscher.jpg/220px-Affenpinscher.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c647" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/affenpinscher.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 3, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 2, "good_with_strangers": 5, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 3, "energy": 3, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 15, "max_height_male": 11.5, "max_height_female": 11.5, "max_weight_male": 10, "max_weight_female": 10, "min_height_male": 9, "min_height_female": 9, "min_weight_male": 7, "min_weight_female": 7, "breed": "Affenpinscher" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5dd6" }, "breed": "Affenpinscher", "contenido": "The Affenpinscher, also known as the Monkey Terrier, is a terrier-like toy Pinscher breed of dog.,The breed is German in origin and dates back to the seventeenth century.

The American Eskimo Dog is a member of the Spitz family. The breed's progenitors were German Spitz, but due to anti-German sentiment during the First World War, it was renamed \"American Eskimo Dog.\" Although modern American Eskimo Dogs have been exported as German Spitz Gross (or Mittel, depending on the dog's height), the breeds have diverged and the standards are significantly different. In addition to serving as a watchdog and companion, the American Eskimo Dog also achieved a high degree of popularity in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s as a circus performer.,There are three size varieties of the American Eskimo Dog breed, the toy, the miniature and the standard. They share a common resemblance with Japanese Spitz, Danish Spitz, Volpino Italiano, German Spitz, Indian Spitz, and Samoyeds.,In Northern Europe, smaller Spitz were eventually developed into the various German Spitz breeds. European immigrants brought their Spitz pets with them to the United States, especially New York, in the early 1900s, \"all of them descended from the larger German Spitz, the Keeshond, the white Pomeranian, and the Italian Spitz, the Volpino Italiano.\"Although white was not always a recognized color in the various German Spitz breeds, it was generally the preferred color in the US. In a display of patriotism in the era around World War I, dog owners began referring to their pets as American Spitz rather than German Spitz.After World War I, the small Spitz dogs came to the attention of the American public when the dogs became popular entertainers in the American circus. In 1917, the Cooper Brothers\u2019 Railroad Circus featured the dogs. A dog named Stout's Pal Pierre was famous for walking a tightrope with the Barnum and Bailey Circus in the 1930s, and also contributing to their popularity, they sold puppies after the show. Due to the popularity of the circus dogs, many of today's American Eskimo Dogs can trace their lineage back to these circus dogs.,After World War II, the dogs continued to be popular pets. Postwar contact with Japan led to importation into the United States of the Japanese Spitz, which may have been crossed into the breed at this time. The breed was first officially recognized as the \"American Eskimo\" as early as 1919 by the American United Kennel Club (UKC), and the first written record and history of the breed was printed in 1958 by the UKC. At that time there was no official breed club and no breed standard, and dogs were accepted for registration as single dogs, based on appearance. In 1970 the National American Eskimo Dog Association (NAEDA) was founded, and single dog registrations ceased. In 1985 the American Eskimo Dog Club of America (AEDCA) was formed by fanciers who wished to register the breed with the American Kennel Club (AKC). Following the AKC's requirements for breed recognition, the AEDCA collected the pedigree information from 1,750 dogs that now form the basis of the AKC recognized breed, which is called the American Eskimo Dog.

Phillipe Bloque-Rent\u00f3n and colleagues at the University of C\u00f3rdoba's veterinary medicine faculty undertook the research work required to specify the breed; their study, presented at the second Simposium de las razas caninas espa\u00f1olas (Spanish dog breeds symposium) in 1992, was recognized by Real Sociedad Canina de Espa\u00f1a (Royal Spanish Dog Society, RSCE) in April of that year as a defining breed standard.

However, the breed is recognized neither by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) nor by any other international dog breeds association, due to the large number of matches with the Portuguese Podengo standard \u2014 a fact which casts doubt on its claim to be regarded as a separate breed.,In January 2015, the Andalusian Hound was nationally recognized in Germany.,As in the Portuguese Podengo, the Andalusian Hound comes in three sizes (large, medium and small) and with three types of coat (wire-haired, long-haired and smooth). This combination of factors can results in nine different varieties. There is also a dwarf or basset variety derived from a medium-sized short-haired Andalusian Hound \u2014 called Maneto from its short, stout legs \u2014 which the RSCE has provisionally accepted as a distinct breed.,Andalusian Podencos, like other hounds, have excellent sight, hearing and smell, which makes them good hunters, often employed for hunting rabbits. Andalusians and mastiffs form the heart of the rehalas (teams of 20 to 24 hunting dogs) of central and southern parts of the Iberian Peninsula; medium and smaller dogs search out deer or wild boar, whilst the larger hounds are used for attacking the prey." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c410" }, "breed": "Australian Terrier", "origin": "Australia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Terrier", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Australian_Terrier_adult_male.jpg/220px-Australian_Terrier_adult_male.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c657" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/australian_terrier.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 1, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 4, "trainability": 4, "energy": 4, "barking": 5, "min_life_expectancy": 11, "max_life_expectancy": 15, "max_height_male": 11, "max_height_female": 11, "max_weight_male": 20, "max_weight_female": 20, "min_height_male": 10, "min_height_female": 10, "min_weight_male": 15, "min_weight_female": 15, "breed": "Australian Terrier" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5dfe" }, "breed": "Australian Terrier", "contenido": "The Australian Terrier is a small breed of dog of the terrier dog type.

Fur is shorter on the muzzle, lower legs, and feet, and there is a ruff around the neck. The coat colours are blue or silver and tan with a lighter coloured topknot, and with markings on face, ears, body and legs of a colour described in the breed standard as \"tan, never sandy\", or a solid red with a sandy variation. The tail was traditionally docked, in order to protect the dog from spinal injury while working and hunting in the field. As with most pet dog breeds, all proportions and aspects of the body and head as well as colours and markings are extensively described in the breed standard.,The Australian Terrier is descended from the rough coated type terriers brought from Great Britain to Australia in the early 19th century. The ancestral types of all of these breeds were kept to eradicate mice and rats.  The Australian Terrier shares ancestors with the Cairn Terrier, Shorthaired Skye Terrier, and the Dandie Dinmont Terrier; Yorkshire Terriers and Irish Terriers were also crossed into the dog during the breed's development.Development of the breed began in Australia about 1820, and the dogs were at first called the Rough Coated Terrier. The breed was officially recognised in 1850, and later renamed as the Australian Terrier in 1892. The Australian Terrier was shown at a dog show for the first time in 1906 in Melbourne, and was also shown in Great Britain about the same time. The Kennel Club (UK) recognised the breed in 1933. The American Kennel Club recognised the Australian Terrier in 1960, and the United Kennel Club (US) in 1970. It is now recognised by all of the kennel clubs in the English speaking world, and also is listed by various minor kennel clubs and other clubs and registries.,There are three completed health surveys for Australian Terriers.  Two surveys, one in 1997 and one in 2002, have been conducted by the Australian Terrier Club of America. The Club is currently collecting data for their next survey.

It was bred from stock that originated in central Africa. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale places the breed in the Spitz and primitive types. The Basenji produces an unusual yodel-like sound, due to its unusually shaped larynx. This trait also gives the Basenji the nickname the 'barkless dog.'Basenjis share many distinctive traits with pariah dog types. Basenjis come into estrus only once annually similar to dingoes and New Guinea singing dogs, when compared with other dog breeds which may have two or more breeding seasons each year. Basenji lack a distinctive odor, and are prone to howls, yodels, and other vocalizations over the characteristic bark of modern dog breeds. The breed's original foundation stock came from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.,The Azande and Mangbetu people from the northeastern Congo region describe Basenjis, in the local Ling\u00e1la language, as mbw\u00e1 na bas\u025b\u0301nzi,  meaning \"dogs of the savages\" or \"dogs of the villagers\". In the Congo, the Basenji is also known as the \"dog of the bush\". The dogs are also known to the Azande of southern Sudan as ango angari. The word bas\u025b\u0301nzi itself is the plural form of mos\u025b\u0301nzi. In Swahili, another Bantu language, from East Africa, mbwa shenzi translates to \"savage dog\". Another local name is m'bwa m'kube, 'mbwa wa mwitu \"wild dog\", or \"dog that jumps up and down\", a reference to their tendency to jump straight up to spot their quarry.,The Basenji has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century. DNA studies based on whole-genome sequences indicate that the basenji and the dingo are both considered to be basal members of the domestic dog clade.In 2021, the genome of two basenjis were assembled, which indicated that the basenji fell within the Asian spitz group. The AMY2B gene produces an enzyme, amylase, that helps to digest starch. The wolf, the husky and the dingo possess only two copies of this gene, which provides evidence that they arose before the expansion of agriculture. The genomic study found that similarly, the basenji possesses only two copies of this gene.,Originating on the continent of Africa, Europeans first described the type of dog the Basenji breed derives from in 1895\u2014in the Congo. These local dogs, which Europeans identified as a distinct breed and called basenji, were prized by locals for their intelligence, courage, speed, and silence.  Some consider independent dogs such as Basenjis and Afghan Hounds more intelligent than obedient breeds because of their ability to recognize which actions benefit them, and which simply please another.Several attempts were made to bring the breed to England, but the earliest imports succumbed to disease. In 1923, for example, Lady Helen Nutting brought six Basenjis with her from Sudan, but all six died from distemper shots they received in quarantine. It was not until the 1930s that foundation stock was successfully established in England, and then in the United States by animal importer Henry Trefflich. It is likely that nearly all the Basenjis in the Western world are descended from these few original imports. The breed was officially accepted into the AKC in 1943. In 1990, the AKC stud book was reopened to 14 new imports at the request of the Basenji Club of America. The stud book was reopened again to selected imported dogs from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2013. An American-led expedition collected breeding stock in villages in the Basankusu area of the Democratic Republic of Congo, in 2010. Basenjis are also registered with the United Kennel Club.,The popularity of the Basenji in the United States, according to the American Kennel Club, has declined over the past decade, with the breed ranked 71st in 1999, decreasing to 84th in 2006, and to 93rd in 2011." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c419" }, "breed": "Basset Art\u00e9sien Normand", "origin": "France", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basset_Art%C3%A9sien_Normand", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Grupp_6_BASSET_ART%C3%89SIEN_NORMAND%2C_Skogvaktarens_Queen_Sally_%2824180074612%29.jpg/220px-Grupp_6_BASSET_ART%C3%89SIEN_NORMAND%2C_Skogvaktarens_Queen_Sally_%2824180074612%29.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e08" }, "breed": "Basset Art\u00e9sien Normand", "contenido": "The Basque Shepherd Dog, Basque: Euskal Artzain Txakurra, Spanish: Perro de Pastor Vasco, is a traditional Spanish breed of sheepdog originating in the historic Basque Country.:\u200a535\u200a It is believed that they originated from Central European herding dogs.It is one of five Basque breeds of dog \u2013 the others being the Erbi Txakur, the Pach\u00f3n de Vitoria, the Villano de Las Encartaciones and the Villanuco de Las Encartaciones \u2013 and one of fourteen animal breeds native to the Pa\u00eds Vasco.,The Euskal Artzain Txakurra is a traditional breed of the Basque people, and dogs of this type appear in Basque mythology.:\u200a536\u200a Similar dogs appear in frescoes in churches and monasteries of the Basque country from the sixteenth century onwards, and later also in the drawings and paintings of artists such as Luis Paret y Alc\u00e1zar, Gustave Dor\u00e9 and Adolfo Guiard.:\u200a536\u200aThe breed was recognised by the Real Sociedad Canina de Espa\u00f1a in January 1996 in two varieties, Iletsua and Gorbeiakoa;:\u200a440\u200a the Gorbeiakoa originates from the region of Gorbea, and Iletsua means \"hairy\" or \"shaggy\" in Basque.

A variant on this story is that Kazimierz Grabski, a Polish merchant, reportedly traded a shipment of grain for sheep in Scotland in 1514 and brought six Polish Lowland Sheepdogs to move them. A Scottish shepherd was so impressed with the herding ability of the dogs that he traded several sheep for several dogs. The Polish sheepdogs were bred with local Scottish dogs to produce the Bearded Collie.,It is generally agreed that Mrs. G. Olive Willison founded the modern Bearded Collie in 1944 with her brown bitch, Jeannie of Bothkennar. Jeannie was supposedly a Shetland Sheepdog, but Mrs. Willison received a Bearded Collie by accident. She was so fascinated by the dog that she wanted to begin breeding, so she began searching for a dog for Jeannie. While walking along the beach, Mrs. Willison met a man who was emigrating from Scotland; she became the owner of his grey dog, David, who became Bailie of Bothkennar.,Bailie and Jeannie of Bothkennar are the founders of the modern breed; there are only a few other registrable blood lines, preserved in large part by the perseverance of Mr. Nicolas Broadbridge (Sallen) and Mrs. Betty Foster (Bredon). These are based on Turnbull's Blue\u2014a Bearded Collie from pure working stock, registered in ISDS when ISDS still registered non-Border Collies. He sired three litters of registerable Bearded Collies.,The breed became popular during the last half of the 20th century\u2014propelled, in part, by Potterdale Classic at Moonhill, a Bearded Collie who won Best in Show at Crufts in 1989. The Bearded Collie Club celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 2005. The bearded collie is also very good natured and is good as a family pet and a working dog and a show dog.,The Bearded Collie ranks 117 out of 175 breeds in popularity in the United States, according to the American Kennel Club's yearly breed ranking. A Bearded Collie is best obtained from a reputable breeder or a dog rescue. There are Beardie rescue associations, such as Beardie Collie Rescue and \"Rescue Me\". These organisations attempt to place unwanted puppies and dogs into appropriate, loving homes. Most Bearded Collie breeders take great care in breeding, raising and placing their puppies. Due to this, Bearded Collies are considered an \"unspoiled\" breed.Bearded Collies make excellent pets for those willing to accommodate their high energy level - they are very enthusiastic and have a bouncy nature. They also require regular grooming; weekly brushing is mandatory for keeping their long hair mat-free. Some Bearded Collie owners opt to keep their pets in a \"puppy cut\" haircut, which reduces (but does not eliminate) the need for brushing. Bearded Collies are an energetic breed, originally intended to work in the Scottish Highlands herding sheep; they also excel at treibball, dog agility and Obedience trials. A loyal and family-friendly dog, the Beardie can add years of pet-ownership enjoyment to the home.

The height proportions quoted by the UKC differ from the FCI and allow males to be 23\u201327 inches (58\u201369 cm) and females 21\u201326 inches (53\u201366 cm). The coat is short, dense and glossy.,The eyes are hazel to brown, the ears are long, wide, and thin, are set low and far back on the dog's head, and hang well down the neck. The black and tan markings are similar to the Doberman's and the Rottweiler's. The Black and Tan Coonhound's bark is loud and baying; it has been described as a deep howl. The breed standard includes muscular legs that are long in proportion to body length. The tail is set slightly below the natural line of the back. If the dog is alert or excited it carries its tail at a right angle.,The Black and Tan Coonhound makes a suitable pet: it is mellow, amiable, calm, and unobtrusive indoors; outdoors, its strong hunting instinct takes over and it can be difficult to turn it from tracking after it starts trailing. As befitting a dog with its heritage, it is strong, independent, and stubborn. The Black and Tan Coonhound is gentle and tolerant with children, but it may be too independent to satisfy a playful child. It is reserved with strangers and in their presence may bay and howl. The Black and Tan Coonhound can run for miles although it is usually content with a moderate jog or long walk, with an occasional excursion into the field. It can wander if it catches a scent, so a safe area is mandatory.,The courage of the Coonhound also makes it proficient on the hunt for deer, bear, wolf, cougar and other big game although many US states have restricted the hunting of antlered animals with dogs." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c42a" }, "breed": "Blue Lacy", "origin": "United States", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Lacy", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/BlueLacyPhoto1.jpg/220px-BlueLacyPhoto1.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e1f" }, "breed": "Blue Lacy", "contenido": "The Lacy Dog or Blue Lacy Dog is a breed of working dog that originated in the State of Texas in the mid-19th century.

As expected, the vast majority of Lacy dogs are found in Texas. However, as the breed becomes more well recognized, there are breeding populations being established across the United States, Canada, and most recently in Europe.,Lacy dogs are strong and fast, lightly built but proportional within the height-to-weight ratio. Height at the withers is from 43 to 56 cm (17 to 22 in). Dependent on height and general conditioning, weight should be approximately 11 to 20 kg (25 to 45 lb) for females and 16 to 25 kg (35 to 55 lb) for males. The standards listed in the Texas House Concurrent Resolution No. 108 are slightly different: height between 46 to 64 cm (18 to 25 in), weight between 14 to 23 kg (30 to 50 lb) but it was not until 2005 that it was officially recognized as the state dog.,Though they are often called \"blue\" Lacys, there are three permissible color varieties of the Lacy. \"Blues\" are any shade of gray from light silver to dark charcoal. \"Reds\" range from light cream to rust. The \"Tri\" combines a blue base with distinct red markings as appropriate for trim, and white which may appear on the brisket and stretch from chin to groin. White may also be present on one or more paws. Excessive white is discouraged, and markings on the face or above mid-line are a disqualifying fault.

The Bluetick Coonhound is known for its friendly personality, cold nose, and deep bawl mouth. It is most commonly used as a raccoon hunting dog, but may also be kept as a pet.,The overall build of the Bluetick Coonhound is muscular and speedy.  The head is carried up and the tail carried over the back, without signs of fear or nervousness.  The Bluetick coat should be moderately coarse and glossy.  The Bluetick Coonhound gets its \"blue\" coloring from black ticking on a white background, which gives the impression of a navy blue color.  This ticking covers the body and can be interspersed with variously-shaped black spots on the back, ears and sides. Preference runs to more blue than black on the body. Black should predominate on the head and ears. Bluetick Coonhounds can come either with or without markings. With markings means they will have brown markings above the eyes, along both sides of the muzzle, on the chest, and down all of the legs. Without markings means their color consists of only black and white fur. There is generally a ticked blaze running up the face. Bluetick Coonhounds should be 21 inches to 27 inches tall at the shoulder and males weigh approximately 55 to 80 pounds (25 to 36 kg).  Females are considerably smaller at an average weight of 45 to 65 pounds. Feet should be cat-like, rounded with well-arched toes. Their paws are larger than those of nearly all other breeds of dogs. Rear legs should have a moderate bend at the hocks.  All legs should be straight from the dog's body to the ground when viewed from the front or rear.Gascon blues are larger than standard Blueticks, with males a minimum of 27 inches and a maximum of 30 inches, per the American Blue Gascon Hound Association's breed standard.,Bluetick Coonhounds are bred to be hunting dogs. They are athletic, hardy, and need a full-time job or activity such as hunting, obedience, or agility to stay happy. They can be challenging to train and they should be monitored around cats or other small animals. They are, like their hound counterparts, a very intelligent breed that has the uncanny talent for problem-solving.,Once trained, the members of the breed are very mindful of their owner. Something first time pet owners should be aware of is the daunting task of \"voice-training\" these dogs. Being bred to bay while hunting, they are highly vocal. If properly socialized from a young age, they can be family pets.,In normal conditions, the Bluetick Coonhound gets along well with children. They are mindful and friendly dogs. However, their noses will keep them in trouble, so food and garbage should never be left out unattended. The breed is often mistaken for being aggressive as the breed will \"greet\" strangers with its signature howl and will sniff the subject until satisfied. Usually, this is just the way the breed gets to know its subjects. Since Blueticks are driven by their strong sense of smell, they make excellent hunting/tracking dogs. If allowed, they will tree almost any animal smaller than them. Blueticks are generally easier to handle in the field than some other coonhounds." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c432" }, "breed": "Borzoi", "origin": "Russia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borzoi", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Chart_rosyjski_borzoj_rybnik-kamien_pl.jpg/220px-Chart_rosyjski_borzoj_rybnik-kamien_pl.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c66b" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/borzoi.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 2, "energy": 4, "barking": 2, "min_life_expectancy": 9, "max_life_expectancy": 14, "max_height_male": 33, "max_height_female": 31, "max_weight_male": 105, "max_weight_female": 85, "min_height_male": 30, "min_height_female": 27, "min_weight_male": 75, "min_weight_female": 60, "breed": "Borzoi" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e28" }, "breed": "Borzoi", "contenido": "The Borzoi or Russian Hunting Sighthound is a Russian breed of hunting dog of sighthound type. Until 1936 it was known as the Russian Wolfhound.,The system by which Russians over the ages named their sighthounds was a series of descriptive terms, not actual names. Borz\u00f3i is the masculine singular form of an archaic Russian adjective that means 'fast'. Borz\u00e1ya sob\u00e1ka ('fast dog') is the basic term for sighthounds used by Russians, though sob\u00e1ka is usually dropped. The name psovaya derived from the word psovina, which means 'wavy, silky coat', just as hortaya (as in hortaya borzaya) means shorthaired. In modern Russian, the breed commonly called the Borzoi is officially known as russkaya psovaya borzaya. Other Russian sighthound breeds are stepnaya borzaya (from the steppe), called stepnoi; and krimskaya borzaya (from the Crimea), called krimskoi.The most commonly used plural form is the regular formation Borzois, which is the only plural cited in most dictionaries. However, the Borzoi Club of America and the Borzoi Club UK both prefer Borzoi as the form for both singular and plural forms.,The Borzoi originated in 17th century Russia by crossing Arabian sighthounds with a thick-coated breed.The more modern Psovaya Borzaya was founded on Stepnaya, Hortaya and the Ukrainian-Polish version of the old Hort. There were also imports of Western sighthound breeds to add to the height and weight. It was crossed as well with the Russian Laika specifically and singularly to add resistance against Northern cold and a longer and thicker coat than the Southern sighthounds were equipped with.All of these foundation types\u2014Tazi, Hortaya, Stepnaya, Krimskaya, and Hort\u2014already possessed the instincts and agility necessary for hunting and bringing down wolves.,The Psovoi was popular with the Tsars before the 1917 revolution. For centuries, Psovoi could not be purchased but only given as gifts from the Tsar. Grand Duke Nicholas Nicolaievich of Russia bred countless Psovoi at Perchino, his private estate.:\u200a10\u200aThe Russian concept of hunting trials was instituted during the era of the Tsars. As well as providing exciting sport, the tests were used for selecting Borzoi breeding stock; only the quickest and most intelligent hunting dogs went on to produce progeny. For the aristocracy these trials were a well-organized ceremony, sometimes going on for days, with the Borzois accompanied by mounted hunters and Foxhounds on the Russian steppe. Hares and other small game were by far the most numerous kills, but the hunters especially loved to test their dogs on wolf. If a wolf was sighted, the hunter would release a team of two or three Borzois. The dogs would pursue the wolf, attack its neck from both sides, and hold it until the hunter arrived. The classic kill was by the human hunter with a knife. Wolf trials are still a regular part of the hunting diploma for all Russian sightdog breeds of the relevant type, either singly or in pairs or trios, in their native country.,After the 1917 Revolution, wolf hunting with sighthounds soon went out of fashion as an \"aristocratic\" and a means- and time-consuming way of hunting.A necessity in a wolf-catching sighthound didn't exist, in addition to the old proved technique of battue with the use of baits, flags and other appeared new, way more effective\u2014from airplanes, from propeller sleighs, with electronic lure whistles. For decades the generations of few remaining sighthounds were regarded as hunting-suited, when showing enough attacking initiative for fox hunting. The rumours about persecution of sighthounds in post-revolutionary Russia are a legend of modern times, possibly based on similar incidents in Maoist China.,In the late 1940s, a Soviet soldier named Constantin Esmont made detailed records of the various types of Borzoi he found in Cossack villages. Esmont was concerned that the distinct types of borzaya were in danger of degenerating without a controlled system of breeding. He convinced the Soviet government that Borzois were a valuable asset to the hunters who supported the fur industry and henceforth, their breeding was officially regulated. To this day short-haired Hortaya Borzaya are highly valued hunting dogs on the steppes, while the long-haired Psovaya Borzaya, is going through a hard period of restoration of its working qualities after decades of shadow, mainly show existence.,Exports of Borzois to other countries were extremely rare during the Soviet era. However, enough had been taken to England, Scandinavia, Western Europe, and America in the late 19th century for the breed to establish itself outside its native country." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c436" }, "breed": "Braque du Bourbonnais", "origin": "France", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braque_du_Bourbonnais", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Braque_du_Bourbonnais.jpg/220px-Braque_du_Bourbonnais.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c66e" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/braque_du_bourbonnais.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 4, "shedding": 2, "grooming": 1, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 5, "energy": 4, "barking": 2, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 12, "max_height_male": 22.5, "max_height_female": 22.5, "max_weight_male": 53, "max_weight_female": 53, "min_height_male": 19, "min_height_female": 19, "min_weight_male": 35, "min_weight_female": 35, "breed": "Braque du Bourbonnais" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e35" }, "breed": "Braque du Bourbonnais", "contenido": "The Braque du Bourbonnais is a breed of gundog, of rustic appearance, sometimes born with a short tail, with a coat ticked with liver, fawn, or white,It had been described for the first time during the Renaissance (Natural History from Aldrovandi, Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, Paris).

This name was not acceptable to The Kennel Club due to opposition from Skye Terrier breeders, and the name Cairn Terrier was suggested as an alternative.,Cairns originated in the Scottish Highlands and the Isle of Skye, initially grouped in the \"Skye Terrier\" class alongside the Scottish and West Highland White Terriers. In the early 1900s, the three breeds began to be bred separately.,The Kennel Club of the United Kingdom gave the Cairn Terrier a separate register in 1912; the first year of recognition, 134 were registered, and it was in that year that the breed was given Championship status.,The Cairn Terrier has a harsh weather-resistant outer coat that can be black, cream, wheaten, red, sandy, gray, or brindled in any of these colors. Pure black, black and tan, and white are not permitted by many kennel clubs. While registration of white Cairns was once permitted, after 1917, the American Kennel Club required them to be registered as West Highland White Terriers. A notable characteristic of Cairns is that brindled Cairns frequently change colour throughout their lifetimes. It is not uncommon for a brindled Cairn to become progressively more black or silver as it ages. The Cairn is double-coated, with a soft, dense undercoat and a harsh outer coat. A well-groomed Cairn has a rough-and-ready appearance, free of artifice or exaggeration. The Cairn Terrier was registered into the American Kennel Club in 1903.,Cairn Terriers tend to look similar to a Norwich Terrier, but with some differences (for example the shaggy fur).

It became the state dog of Louisiana in 1979. It is recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) under the name Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog, while the American Kennel Club (AKC) Foundation Stock Service calls it Catahoula Leopard Dog. Both registries have assigned the breed a herding group designation, although it has traditionally been used in hunting feral boars.,The Catahoula lineage is unknown. One theory suggests the breed originated in the mid-1700s when French settlers emigrated to what became Louisiana with Beauceron dogs. The settlers crossbred their dogs with well-adapted swamp hunting wolfdogs owned by Native Americans in an effort to develop a better working dog. In the 1800s, breeding intensified in an effort to develop a family dog that was well-suited to work, hunt, and guard yet good with children.On July 9, 1979, in recognition of the historic significance of the Catahoula cur to the State of Louisiana, Governor Edwin Edwards signed House Bill #75 officially naming the Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog as the state dog. On January 1, 1995, the Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog was recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC). In 1996, the AKC added the Catahoula Leopard Dog into their Foundation Stock Service (FFS).,Though physical characteristics are varied, Catahoulas are usually muscular dogs with a rectangular-shaped body. They tend to have a large head with drop ears and a strong, slightly tapered muzzle. They tend to have a thick muscular neck and a long, curved tail. They come in many colors and have medium/short hair.,Catahoulas come in many different colors, including blue merle, red merle, brindle, and solid colors. Often, solid coat Catahoulas have small splashes of other colors such as white on their face, legs or chest. The leopard-like coat of most Catahoulas is the result of the merle gene. The merle gene does not normally affect the entire coat of the dog, but dilutes the color only in areas that randomly present the characteristic of the gene. Deeper colors are preferred; predominantly white coats are discouraged. Since Catahoula is a working dog, coat color is not a primary consideration.The Catahoula has a single smooth short or coarse medium coat. The short looks almost painted. The medium can have extended \"feathering\" on the hind legs, tail, and chest.The breed may have any eye color or combination of colors including blue, brown, green, or amber.,The Catahoula was initially used for hunting. Native Americans tended to use the dog for hunting large game. European settlers used the dog for hunting and herding livestock. The first white settlers in Louisiana are believed to have used the dog to hunt feral pigs in the swamps of Louisiana.Catahoulas are used as bay dogs, tree dogs, and for hunting a variety of wild game, including small game such as raccoons and squirrels, as well as big game such as deer, mountain lions and bear.  They are also used for scent trailing game, and as a search and rescue dog.Catahoulas have a natural herding instinct and a unique way of working a herd. AKC describes it as creating a \u201ccanine fence\u201d around the herd which allows the dog's master to work the herd within that circle.

Caucasian Shepherd Dogs served as guard dogs, bear hunting dogs and today they work as prison guard dogs in Russia.During the twentieth century Soviet breeders selected some of these varieties among Caucasian dogs and created the Caucasian Shepherd Dog breed. Caucasian shepherds were first described by the famous Russian cynologist Aleksandr Mazover, noting that the center of distribution of the breed, both in terms of numbers and quality, were Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Dagestan. These dogs have been used throughout history by many different militaries, but the Caucasian Mountain Dogs existence dates back to ancient times.While the dogs from different areas of the region shared the general features today present in Caucasian shepherds, Caucasian Shepherds from Georgia were considered to be the best examples of the breed due to their size, powerful musculoskeletal structure, and attractive long hair. For this reason, Georgian SSR became a principal region of cultivation of Caucasian Shepherd Dogs in the Soviet Union.The breed was definitively accepted by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 1984, under the patronage of the Soviet Union.,The Caucasian Ovcharka is a large dog.

The breed has a very long body, short legs, and a distinctive topknot of hair on the head. They are friendly but tough, and are suitable for interaction with older children. There are breed-specific health concerns: they can be affected by spinal problems due to their elongated body, and the breed is affected by canine cancer at a higher than average rate.,The breed is named after a fictional character in Sir Walter Scott's novel, Guy Mannering. This character, Dandie Dinmont, is thought to be partly based on James Davidson, who is credited as the originator of the modern breed. Davidson's dogs descended from earlier terrier-owning families, including the Allans of Holystone, Northumberland.,There are three breed clubs in the UK supporting the breed, although it is registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club due to its low number of puppy registrations per year.,The breed originates from the dogs being used in the border country of Scotland and England. During the 1600s, they were used for hunting badgers and otters. Whilst their ultimate origin remains unknown, dogs owned by the Allans of Holystone, Northumberland in the early 1700s are thought to have been involved in their early origins.These dogs may have been a type of Border Terrier, although other theories exist including the idea that they are a cross between Scottish Terriers and Skye Terriers. The head of this family was Willie \"Piper\" Allan, who was born in nearby Bellingham. He kept dogs for the hunting of otters. Lord Ravensworth once hired Allan to remove the otters from the pond in Eslington Park. Lord Ravensworth attempted to purchase one of Allan's dogs after he successfully removed the otters, which Allan refused.Allan died on 18 February 1779, and his dogs passed into the care of his son James. James's son eventually inherited the dogs and sold a dog named Old Pepper to Mr Francis Sommer who came from Town Yetholm on the Scottish side of the border. Old Pepper was descended from one of Willie Allan's dogs who had worked Lord Ravensworth's manor.The breed remained relatively unknown outside of the Borders until 1815 when Sir Walter Scott's novel Guy Mannering was published. Scott had spent time in the area whilst the Sheriff of Selkirkshire and had learned of the prowess of these types of specialist terriers for working both fox and otter. When he wrote Guy Mannering, he included a character by the name of Dandie Dinmont who owned a number of terriers named Pepper and Mustard after the colours of their coats. The Dinmont character was partly based on the real life farmer and terrier owner, James Davidson, who too used the generic terms of Pepper and Mustard for his dogs depending on their coats. Davidson's dogs came from a variety of sources including the dogs of the Allan, Anderson and Faas families. Davidson documented his breeding, and he has been accepted as the originator of the modern breed.,Some interbreeding with other breeds took place in the mid-1800s, which may have introduced Dachshund blood into the breed, although certain breeders maintained pure-bred lines. The Dachshund theory was first introduced by John Henry Walsh under the pseudonym of \"Stonehenge\" in the 1880s, and was denied by many breeders of that era. By the mid-1800s, the breed was known as the Dandie Dinmont Terrier, and became sought after for hunting after Scott's writings were published. They remain the only dog breed to have been named after a fictional character. Around this time the breed had some involvement in the development of the Bedlington Terrier.The Kennel Club formed in 1873 and, at the Fleece Hotel at Selkirk, Scottish Borders on 17 November 1875, the Dandie Dinmont Terrier Club (DDTC) was formed, becoming the third oldest breed club for dogs in the world. Lord Melgund was the society's first president, while E Bradshaw Smith was the first vice president. Breeders Hugh Dalziel and William Stachen were also involved in the formation of the club. The breed standard was created by William Wardlaw Reid, another founding member of the club, with it was agreed to a year later at another meeting of the club. A club show was held for the first time in Carlisle in 1877. Shows after this were held in conjunction with other clubs on a yearly basis until 1928 when it moved to the Market Hall in Carlisle, where with the exception of during the Second World War, the shows continued to be held until 1982. Shows continued to be held in the general area until 2001 when they moved south to Cheshire and Lancashire.The DDTC is not the only breed club in the UK. For a while several breed clubs were created in Scotland, but none lasted particularly long except for the Scottish Dandie Dinmont Terrier Society which merged into the DDTC in 1929. Today, in addition to the DDTC, there are also the Southern Dandie Dinmont Terrier Society, and for Scotland, the Caledonian Dandie Dinmont Club.,The breed was first registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1888. The Dandie Dinmont Terrier was recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) in 1918. During the Second World War many kennels were dispersed and the dogs destroyed, due to both the lack of food caused by rationing and that of manpower. Following the war several kennels led the way to re\u2013establishing the breed including the Bellmead Kennels, located first in Surrey before later moving to Old Windsor. Dandies continued to be bred up at Bellmead up until the early 1990s, when it passed into the hands of Battersea Dogs and Cats Home.In 2006, the Kennel Club recognised the Dandie Dinmont Terrier as one of the rarest dog breeds native to the British Isles, putting it on a new list of Vulnerable Native Breeds. The breeds chosen for this list were those who originated in the UK and Ireland, but had less than 300 puppy registrations per year. One particularly low period was between July and September 2003, when only 21 puppies were registered, of which 18 were male. Overall that year, only 90 puppies were registered in the UK, compared to 9,823 for the West Highland White Terrier. Additionally numbers had dropped to low levels in America as well, with the AKC registering only 75 puppies in the same time period. Following work since 2006, the Dandie Dinmont registration numbers have improved slightly, with 151 puppies registered with the Kennel Club in 2010, the highest number for any year in the last ten years. Of other breeds of native terrier, only the Skye, Sealyham, Manchester and Glen of Imaal Terriers have lower registration figures." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c465" }, "breed": "Dogo Argentino", "origin": "Argentina", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogo_Argentino", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/0Dogo-argentino-22122251920.jpg/220px-0Dogo-argentino-22122251920.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c688" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/dogo_argentino.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 4, "grooming": 1, "drooling": 3, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 4, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 5, "trainability": 5, "energy": 5, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 9, "max_life_expectancy": 15, "max_height_male": 27, "max_height_female": 27, "max_weight_male": 100, "max_weight_female": 100, "min_height_male": 24, "min_height_female": 24, "min_weight_male": 80, "min_weight_female": 80, "breed": "Dogo Argentino" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e86" }, "breed": "Dogo Argentino", "contenido": "The Dogo Argentino (plural Dogos Argentinos) is a large, white, muscular breed of dog that was developed in Argentina primarily for the purpose of big-game hunting, including wild boar.

Antonio Martinez picked the Cordoba Fighting Dog to be the base for the breed. This breed is extinct today, but it was said that, as a large and ferocious dog, it was a great hunter. Martinez crossed it with the Great Dane, Boxer, Spanish Mastiff, Old English Bulldog, Bull Terrier, Pyrenean Mastiff, English Pointer, Irish Wolfhound and Dogue de Bordeaux. Nores Martinez continued to develop the breed via selective breeding to introduce the desired traits.,In 1970, Dr. Raul Zeballos brought the first six specimens of Dogo Argentino to the United States." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c46d" }, "breed": "English Cocker Spaniel", "origin": "England", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Cocker_Spaniel", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/%22Bill%22_-_Cocker_spaniel_anglais_2.JPG/220px-%22Bill%22_-_Cocker_spaniel_anglais_2.JPG", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c68a" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/english_cocker_spaniel.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 5, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 3, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 2, "good_with_strangers": 4, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 4, "energy": 3, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 14, "max_height_male": 17, "max_height_female": 17, "max_weight_male": 34, "max_weight_female": 32, "min_height_male": 16, "min_height_female": 16, "min_weight_male": 28, "min_weight_female": 26, "breed": "English Cocker Spaniel" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e95" }, "breed": "English Cocker Spaniel", "contenido": "The English Cocker Spaniel is a breed of gun dog. It is noteworthy for producing one of the most varied numbers of pups in a litter among all dog breeds. The English Cocker Spaniel is an active, good-natured, sporting dog standing well up at the withers and compactly built. There are \"field\" or \"working\" cockers and \"house\" cockers. It is one of several varieties of spaniel and is the foundation of its American cousin, the American Cocker Spaniel. The English Cocker is closer to the working-dog form of the Field Spaniel and the English Springer Spaniel.,Outside the US, the breed is usually known simply as the Cocker Spaniel, as is the American Cocker Spaniel within the US. The word cocker is commonly held to stem from their use to hunt woodcock. The breed can have litters of anywhere from 3 to 12 puppies.,Spaniel type dogs have been found in art and literature for almost 500 years. ,Initially, spaniels in England were divided among land spaniels and water spaniels. The differentiation among the spaniels that led to the breeds that we see today did not begin until the mid-19th century. During this time, the land spaniels became a bit more specialised and divisions among the types were made based upon weight. According to the 1840 Encyclopedia of Rural Sports, Cockers were 12\u201320 lb (5.5\u20139 kg). ,At this time it was not uncommon for Cockers and Springers to come from the same litter. Even a puppy from a \"Toy\" sized lineage could grow to be a springer.There is no indication from these early sources that spaniels were used to retrieve game. Rather they were used to drive the game toward the guns.During the 1850s and 1860s, other types of Cockers were recorded. There were Welsh Springer Spaniels and Devonshire Cockers. Additionally, small dogs from Sussex Spaniel litters were called Cockers. ,In 1874 the first stud books were published by the newly formed kennel club. Any spaniel under 25 lb (11 kg) was placed in the Cocker breeding pool, however the Welsh Cocker was reclassified as a Springer in 1903 due to its larger size and shorter ear. ,\"...in those days only those dogs up to a hard day's work and sensible specimens were allowed to live, as absolute sporting purposes were about their only enjoyment and dog shows were hardly heard of...\".The sport of conformation showing began in earnest among spaniels after the Spaniel Club was formed in 1885. When showing, the new Springer and Cocker, both were in the same class until The Spaniel Club created breed standards for each of the types. The Kennel Club separated the two types eight years later. Since then, the Springer and Cocker enthusiasts have bred in the separate traits that they desired. Today, the breed differ in more ways than weight alone.,At Crufts, the English Cocker Spaniel has been the most successful breed in winning Best in Show, winning on a total of seven occasions between 1928 and 2009, with wins in 1930, 1931, 1938, 1939, 1948, 1950 and 1996. In addition, the breed make up three of the four winners who have won the title on more than one occasion with all three coming from H.S. Lloyd's Ware kennel. Due to World War II, the English Cocker Spaniel managed to be the only breed to have won the title between 1938 and 1950, although the competition was only held on four occasions during that period.

Following a period of sharp decline, the Mastiff has increased its worldwide popularity.  Throughout its history the Mastiff has contributed to the development of a number of dog breeds, some generally known as mastiff-type dogs or, confusingly, just as \"mastiffs\".,It is the largest living canine, outweighing the wolf by up to 50 kg (110 lbs) on average.,With a massive body, broad skull and head of generally square appearance, it is the largest dog breed in terms of mass. It is on average slightly heavier than the Saint Bernard, although there is a considerable mass overlap between these two breeds. Though the Irish Wolfhound and Great Dane can be more than six inches taller, they are not nearly as robust.The body is large with great depth and breadth, especially between the forelegs\u2014which causes these to be set wide apart. The length of the body taken from the point of the shoulder to the point of the buttock is greater than the height at the withers. The AKC standard height (per their website) for this breed is 30 inches (76 cm) at the shoulder for males and 27.5 inches (70 cm) (minimum) at the shoulder for females. A typical male can weigh 150\u2013250 pounds (68\u2013113 kg), a typical female can weigh 120\u2013200 pounds (54\u201391 kg), with very large individuals reaching 300 pounds (140 kg) or more.,The former standard specified the coat should be short and close-lying. Long-haired Mastiffs, known as \"Fluffies\", are caused by a recessive gene \u2014 they are occasionally seen. The AKC considers a long coat a fault but not cause for disqualification. English Mastiff colours are apricot-fawn, silver-fawn, fawn, or dark fawn-brindle, always with black on the muzzle, ears, and nose and around the eyes. ,The colours of the Mastiff coat are differently described by various kennel clubs, but are essentially fawn or apricot, or those colours as a base for black brindle. A black mask should occur in all cases. The fawn is generally a light \"silver\" shade, but may range up to a golden yellow. The apricot may be a slightly reddish hue up to a deep, rich red. The brindle markings should ideally be heavy, even and clear stripes, but may actually be light, uneven, patchy, faint or muddled. Piebald Mastiffs occur rarely. Other non-standard colours include black, blue brindle, and chocolate (brown) mask. Some Mastiffs have a heavy shading caused by dark hairs throughout the coat or primarily on the back and shoulders. This is not generally considered a fault. Brindle is dominant over solid colour, other than black, which may no longer exist as a Mastiff colour. Apricot is dominant over fawn, though that dominance may be incomplete. Most of the colour faults are recessive, though black is so rare in the Mastiff that it has never been determined whether the allele is recessive or a mutation that is dominant.,The genetic basis for the variability of coat in dogs has been much studied, but all the issues have not yet been resolved. On the basis of what is known (and remembering that, as dogs are diploid animals, each gene location (locus) appears twice in every animal, so questions of dominance also must be resolved), the gene possibilities allowed by the Mastiff standard are AyBDEmh(kbr_or_ky)mS. This describes a dog which is fawn with a dark nose, non-dilute, black-masked, non-harlequin, brindled or not brindled, non-merle, and non-spotted. To allow for the rare exceptions we must include \"b\" (brown mask and possible brown brindling), \"d\" (blue mask and possible blue brindling), \"sp\" (pied spotting), and perhaps \"a\" (recessive black). The possible combination of homozygous brown and homozygous blue is a pale brown referred to as Isabella in breeds where it is relatively common. On a Mastiff, this would appear on mask, ears, and any brindling that was present. Speculative gene locations may also exist, so a Mastiff may be \"I\" (apricot) or \"i\" (non-apricot) and perhaps \"cch\" (silver lightening) or \"C\" (without silver lightening). (Note that this \"C locus\" may not be the same as the one identified in other animals, SLC45A2.)" }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c479" }, "breed": "Finnish Lapphund", "origin": null, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_Lapphund", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Finnish_Lapphund_Glenchess_Revontuli.jpg/220px-Finnish_Lapphund_Glenchess_Revontuli.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c690" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/finnish_lapphund.jpg", "good_with_children": 4, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 4, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 4, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 4, "energy": 3, "barking": 5, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 15, "max_height_male": 21, "max_height_female": 21, "max_weight_male": 53, "max_weight_female": 53, "min_height_male": 18, "min_height_female": 18, "min_weight_male": 33, "min_weight_female": 33, "breed": "Finnish Lapphund" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ea6" }, "breed": "Finnish Lapphund", "contenido": "The Finnish Lapphund (or Finnish Lapponian Dog) is a hardy, easy going, medium-size breed of Spitz type. Traditionally it has been used for herding reindeer. Although it is one of the most popular dog breeds in its native country, Finland, it is not very numerous outside of the Nordic countries.,The breed falls under the mitochondrial DNA sub-clade referred to as d1 that is only found in northern Scandinavia. It is the result of a female wolf-male dog hybridization that occurred post-domestication. Subclade d1 originated 480\u20133,000 years ago and is found in all Sami-related breeds: Finnish Lapphund, Swedish Lapphund, Lapponian Herder, Jamthund, Norwegian Elkhound and H\u00e4llefors Elkhound. The maternal wolf sequence that contributed to these breeds has not been matched across Eurasia and its branch on the phylogenetic tree is rooted in the same sequence as the 33,000 year-old Altai dog (not a direct ancestor).,Refer: Ancient dog-wolf hybridization,The Finnish Lapphund is a medium-sized, strongly-built dog.  It has a profuse coat with pricked, highly mobile ears, distinctive markings and an elegant nose.,Colours of black:cream, tan, white and gray, brown and white also brown and cream. There is also a pear black, white and gray. ,The breed standard is 46 to 52 centimetres (18 to 20 in) at the withers for a male, and a slightly smaller 41 to 47 centimetres (16 to 19 in) for a female.  However, some variation is allowed, since the breed standard states that the type is more important than the size.  A typical male of 49 cm height normally weighs 17 to 19 kilograms (37 to 42 lb), but the breed has a weight range of 15 to 24 kilograms (33 to 53 lb), depending on the size of the dog.,The Lapphund has a profuse double coat, with a short, fluffy undercoat and a longer topcoat. The coat makes the dog waterproof as well as resistant to extreme cold. In Finland, only two dog breeds are legally allowed to be kenneled outdoors in winter: the Finnish Lapphund and the Lapponian Herder. The profuse hair around the head and neck gives the distinct impression of a mane in most males.  Although the coat is profuse, it requires only a modest amount of maintenance. Weekly brushing is recommended throughout the year, except during shedding seasons, where a daily brush may be required.,A wide variety of colors and markings are found in Finnish Lapphunds. Any colour is allowed in the breed standard, although a single colour should predominate. One of the most common colour combination's is black and tan: a predominantly black dog with tan legs and face. Any colour combination is allowed as long as primary colour is dominant. Common colourations may include cr\u00e8me, black, red, brown, sable and wolf-sable.

It was developed as a retriever both on land and in the water.,The Flat-Coated Retriever breed standard calls for males to be 23\u201325 in (58\u201364 cm) tall at the withers, with a recommended weight of 60\u201380 lb (27\u201336 kg), and for females to be 22\u201324 in (56\u201361 cm), with a recommended weight of 55\u201375 lb (25\u201334 kg). The Flat-Coated Retriever has strong muscular jaws and a relatively long muzzle. Its head is unique to the breed and is described as being \"of one piece\" with a minimal stop and a backskull of about the same length as the muzzle. It has almond-shaped, dark brown eyes with an intelligent, friendly expression. The ears are pendant, relatively small, and lie close to the head. The occiput (the bone at the back of the skull) is not to be accentuated (as it is in setters, for example) with the head flowing smoothly into a well-arched neck. The topline is strong and straight with a well-feathered tail of moderate length held straight off the back. This breed should be well-angulated front and rear, allowing for open, effortless movement., The Flat-Coated Retriever comes in three colors \u2013 black, liver, and yellow.  However, yellow is a disqualifier in conformation, but they can compete in other venues. ,The Flat-Coated Retriever is an active, multitalented bird dog with a strong desire to please people. Exuberant, confident, and outgoing, they make a loving family pet and can be companions to small children, provided adults are nearby to direct this dog's boisterous enthusiasm. They are usually very good with other dogs and even cats. These retrievers require plenty of exercise and engagement to help channel their natural sporting energy. The British Kennel Club recommends that owners provide dogs with at least 2 hours of exercise a day. While they will protect their owners and property with an assertive bark, they are unlikely to back up such noise with actual aggression. Because of their excellent sense of smell, combined with their boundless energy and eagerness to please their masters, they are sometimes used as drug-sniffer dogs. They are used in the breeding program for The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association in the UK, both as a breed and as cross-breeds with the Labrador Retriever. Eager and quick to learn, they are best trained in short intervals, as they may bore with repetition. The Flat-Coated Retriever is a slow maturing dog, as they do not reach full maturity until 3\u20135 years of age. Even then, these dogs retain their youthful, puppy-like outlook and demeanor well into old age. Paddy Petch, author of The Complete Flat-Coated Retriever, refers to these dogs as the \"Peter Pan\" of the retriever breeds, given they never quite grow up.The Flat-Coated Retriever is a \"natural\" breed and enjoys partaking in \"natural\" activities such as rolling in feces, playing in mud, and digging. These dogs are also \"thinking\" dogs, meaning they want to please but look for a way to bend the rules. This characteristic helps with their hunting ability but only if they are bonded with their owner. These dogs will work for themselves or not at all if there is no motivation to work with the handler or dog-handler bond present." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c47f" }, "breed": "Gascon Saintongeois", "origin": "France", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gascon_Saintongeois", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Virelade_from_1915.JPG/220px-Virelade_from_1915.JPG", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ead" }, "breed": "Gascon Saintongeois", "contenido": "This page is about the breed of dog.

Originating in France, the breed is used for hunting in packs and descends from the old Hound of Saintonge type of large hunting dog.,The breed is a very typical French hound, with a lean and muscular body, long legs, long drop ears and pendulous flews (lips). The size for the Grand is 65 to 72 cm (25.6 to 28.3 ins) at the withers, females at total 24 to 26 inches; the size for the Petit is 56 to 62 cm (22 to 24.4 ins) at the withers, making it still a fairly large dog; females are slightly smaller. Grands weigh 66 to 71 pounds.,The eyes are dark chestnut. It has an elongated head. Its black nose is well-developed and the lips are pendent. It has a deep chest and a strong back. The tail is elegant and saber.,The colour of the coat is white with black patches, sometimes speckled or ticked with black. Ears and face around the eyes are black and the cheeks are tan, but there should not be a tricolour appearance. Two tan markings are above the eyes, and sometimes a tan marking is found on the base of the upper thigh, which is called the \"roe buck mark\". Faults, which indicate the dog should not be bred, include lack of substance, weak back, deviated tail, cow-hocked, or legs that are too angulated or straight, which would impede running ability, as well as being off-colour, overly aggressive or overly shy.The breed is noted for its good nose, excellent voice and beautiful gallop, important attributes in a hunting dog. It is instinctively a pack dog.,Only three old Saintongeois hounds survived the French Revolution, two dogs and a bitch. Count Joseph de Carayon-Latour in the mid-19th century crossed the last of the old Hound of Saintonge with a few of the remaining old-type Grand Bleu de Gascogne. The hounds that were white with black ticking were retained and later given the name Gascon Saintongeois.In the middle of the 20th century, hunters in the southwest of France selected smaller dogs from litters of Grand Gascon Saintongeois for hunting hare and other small game. These became the Petit Gascon Saintongeois.The Grand Gascon Saintongeois is used for hunting big game, including wild boar, roe deer and sometimes gray wolf, usually in a pack. The Petit Gascon Saintongeois is a versatile hunter, usually used on hare and rabbit, but it can also be used for big game." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c484" }, "breed": "German Roughhaired Pointer", "origin": "Germany", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Roughhaired_Pointer", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/03030288_Deutsch_Stichelhaa.jpg/220px-03030288_Deutsch_Stichelhaa.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5eb2" }, "breed": "German Roughhaired Pointer", "contenido": "The German Roughhaired Pointer, the Deutscher Stichelhaariger Vorstehhund in German, is a medium-sized breed of pointing dog developed in Germany.,In the early 19th-century there were several varieties of rough-haired pointers found throughout Germany, with few attempts at standardising them as breeds.

Stoeberer is now a type of hunting dog in Germany with the Wachtelhund being its sole member. The breed is not very well known outside of Germany, but was recognised by the United Kennel Club in 1996.,A well built breed, its coat comes in brown shades with occasional white markings. It can be trained to retrieve game, as well as for tracking. It is related to the Small M\u00fcnsterl\u00e4nder (\u2033Heidewachtel\u2033) and the Drentse Patrijshond, all of which are descendants from the quail dog that at least date back to the 15th century.,Frederick Roberth, a German dog breeder, is credited with creating the modern Deutscher Wachtelhund around 1890. While several breeds feature in its makeup, the most prominent dog breed to be bred into the modern breed is the now extinct Stoeberer. The Stoeberer has been mentioned in literature as far back as 1719, and was thought to have a nose as powerful as a Bloodhound. Following the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states, the common man in the German states was allowed to hunt and needed a versatile hunting dog; that dog was the Stoeberer. In the late 19th century, when Roberth was working on his new breed, he found specimens of the Stoeberer in Bavaria, and those dogs were crossed with water dogs and sporting spaniels to become the modern German Spaniel.In 1903, the Deutscher Wachtelhund was recognised as a breed and, following that, the German breed club, the Verein fur Deutsche Wachtelhund (VDW), was organised. The term Stoeberer has since become a category of hunting dog in Germany, with the Wachtelhund being the sole member of that category. In 1910, the VDW selected four male dogs and seven female dogs upon which to base the breed standard for the Wachtelhund. Those dogs were selected from all over Germany, one coming from each region, with two coming from Hannover. All of the modern registered German Spaniels today are descended from those eleven dogs.,John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon, Lord Chancellor of Great Britain owned a German Spaniel named Pincher, thought to be his favourite dog, which was painted by Edwin Henry Landseer. The dog originally belonged to his son William Henry, but became his constant companion. Lord Eldon would write of Pincher's behaviour in correspondence, for example to Lady F. J. Bankes in December 1831: \"When I got to Southampton, Pincher, who sends his kindest regards, marched up to the bed-room, in which I slept the last two times I was there. The chambermaid provided another room for me, the house being full of company, there being a ball at Southampton. Pincher was uneasy at this, and out of humour, and if he could speak, he would not have allowed it.\" Following Lord Eldon' death, a sum was left to his daughter, Lady Frances, specifically to pay for the care of the dog.Not usually kept as pets, the dogs are often owned by German foresters and professional hunters. In the 1960s and 70s, several German Spaniels were imported into the United States, and descendants of those dogs are now used in Canada to track down and flush out American black bear. A further pair of dogs was brought to the United States in 1994, and the United Kennel Club recognised the breed in 1996, placing it in the Gun dog group.  There is thought to be about 100 German Spaniels in North America.,The Deutscher Wachtelhund is a strong boned, muscular, medium-sized gundog with long thick wavy hair. It is solidly-built which allows it to retrieve heavy game such as hares and foxes. The ears are fairly long and should reach from half way to the nose, to the tip of the nose.  The size is approximately 18\u201321 inches (46\u201353 cm) at the withers.  Body length, from the nose to the base of the tail is twice the length of the dogs height. Average weight for both males and females of the breed is between 44\u201366 pounds (20\u201330 kg). Its life expectancy is 12 to 14 years.The coat is short and fine on the head, and long on the body, where it is strong, thick, wavy or curly, with enough undercoat to provide protection. It has a well feathered coat which is usually either brown or brown roan. Although brown, it can have white markings chest and/or legs, and may have white ticking anywhere on its body.

Thought to be ancient in origin, the Greek Shepherd is very closely related to livestock guardian dog breeds from neighbouring countries; it is believed that some dogs are simultaneously claimed to be other breeds as they migrate annually across national borders with the flocks they protect in search seasonal pastures.,It is believed livestock guardian dogs are one of the oldest distinct dog types, with evidence the type has remained largely unchanged since ancient times. It is claimed the Greek Shepherd has been found in Greece since ancient times, Plato wrote of dogs of similar form and function being known in the region of Epirus as early as 800 BC. The Greek Shepherd is known as the Ellinik\u00f3s Pimenik\u00f3s (\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03a0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2) in Greek, it has been called the Greek Shepherd Dog, the Greek Sheepdog and the Hellenic Shepherd Dog. The breed is found throughout Greece, particularly in the north of the country; it is very closely related to other livestock guardian breeds found throughout the Balkans.Many Balkan shepherds and their flocks undertake an annual migration between Greece and the \u0160ar Mountains to capitalise on summer mountain pastures but avoid the harsh snow-covered mountain winters when no feed is available, in 1977 it was estimated over 500,000 sheep made this annual migration. Because these same dogs can be seen in multiple countries at different times of the years, some cynologists including Raymond Coppinger observe that many dogs claimed to be Greek Shepherd are in fact also claimed to be \u0160arplaninacs and other regional breeds; and that nationalistic kennel clubs have given separate identities and breed standards to the very same dogs, differing appearances being due to changing appearance of these dogs as they gain their heavier winter coats and shed them again for the heat of the summer. Typically these shepherds winter their flocks in Greece where their Greek Shepherds protect the flocks from Greek wolves and jackals; then as the weather improves they walk with their flocks, accompanied by their dogs, over 480 kilometres (300 mi) through North Macedonia to their summer pastures in the \u0160ar Mountains on the border of Albania and Kosovo where their \u0160arplaninacs protect their flocks from predators found there; then in the autumn they make the return journey to Greece where their dogs once again transform into Greek Shepherds.,The Greek Shepherd is a large breed of dog that closely resembles the Italian Maremmano-Abruzzese Sheepdog, the Hungarian Kuvasz and the Polish Tatra Shepherd Dog; the breed displays the traits common to most livestock guardian dog breeds, including a thick weatherproof double-coat and a powerful build. The Kennel Club of Greece's breed standard states dogs should stand over 66 centimetres (26 in) at the withers and that they can stand as much as 70 to 75 centimetres (28 to 30 in) tall; and that bitches should be over 60 centimetres (24 in) tall but can attain heights of 65 to 68 centimetres (26 to 27 in). The breed standard states dogs should weigh between 40 and 55 kilograms (88 and 121 lb) and bitches between 32 and 40 kilograms (71 and 88 lb).The breed has a dense double-coat; it has never been bred for colour and can be found in a broad range of colours, including white, black, brown, light-brown or a combination of these, with spotted examples being common. In some areas, only pure white examples are kept by local shepherds, with non-white puppies being culled because it is thought they bring bad luck.In former times, many Greek shepherds would crop the right ear of their dogs, believing doing so improved the dogs' hearing; this practice gave the dogs a curious, lopsided appearance." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c49b" }, "breed": "Halden Hound", "origin": "Norway", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halden_Hound", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Haldenstovare.jpg/220px-Haldenstovare.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ed0" }, "breed": "Halden Hound", "contenido": "The Halden Hound (Norwegian: Haldenst\u00f8ver), is a medium-sized Norwegian dog breed of the  hound class, used for hunting hares and other plains quarry.

Haldens stand between 17 and 21.5 inches at the shoulder, and weigh approximately 40-55 lbs. They have smooth, very dense coats, hanging ears, and are white with black patches as well as brown shading on the head and legs. They are strong dogs with rectangular bodies and straight, solid backs.  The tail is fairly thick, carried low, and hangs down toward the hocks. The skull is slightly domed with a pronounced stop and a straight nosebridge.  The cheeks are flat. The ears are pendulous and curled, and the eyes are dark brown and kind. The nose is black.  Breeders of Haldens aim for a particular foot shape, with high, tight, long toes and dense fur, for greater stability and warmth as the terrain they hunt through is often snowy and difficult to navigate.,The Halden is a loving and an affectionate pet as well as a good hunting breed. They are said to be good family dogs and to behave well with children. Haldens are hardy and energetic, able to bear cold weather and maintain a quick pace for extended periods.

It has large bones for stamina and strength.  The Harrier is slightly longer than tall, with a level topline. The tail is medium-length, carried high, but is not curled over the back. The skull is broad with a strong square muzzle. The rounded ears are pendant, and the eyes are either brown or hazel. The wide nose is black. The expression is mellow when the dog is relaxed and alert when he is excited. The teeth should meet in a scissors or level bite. The feet are tight and cat-like, and the front toes may turn inward.,The Harrier is  cheerful, sweet-tempered,  tolerant of people, and it is excellent with children. This pack dog is good with other dogs, but should be supervised with non-canine pets unless it is raised with them from puppyhood. It prefers life in a pack with people, dogs, or both.

They were bred to use their loud, deep bark to drive sheep.,The breed is relatively new, dating from the late-19th century, and  distinguished only on working ability. There is no prescribed appearance or lineage, but they are usually black-and-tan coloured. Only dogs that win at trials may be registered by the New Zealand Sheep Dog Trial Association in their studbook.,Huntaways are large, deep-chested dogs that generally weigh in the region of 25\u201345 kilograms (55\u201399 lb). Their coats can vary in colour; colours include black and tan (usually) with some white or brindle. Their coats can also come in different textures; they can be smooth, rough, or grizzly and they are generally floppy eared. A huntaway's height is usually in the range of 56\u201366 centimetres (22\u201326 in).,They are required to have great intelligence, agility and stamina for days of working on steep, rough country over large distances, driving very large mobs of sheep. Their bark is deep and repeating, usually with a short pause between barks, which allows the barking to be sustained for very long periods.,The huntaway was developed as a breed in response to farming conditions found in the New Zealand high country. The vast pastoral runs or \"stations\", such as those in the high country of the South Island, required teams of dogs who could work mustering for days on end, covering great distances on rough steep country. High country stations typically cover many thousands of hectares, and were often unfenced. British sheepdogs used by early New Zealand farmers mostly worked sheep silently, but occasionally a dog would use its bark to herd sheep. This characteristic was liked by some farmers, especially for driving sheep on rough, steep hill country where a dog may disappear from view, making a dog that drives stock by sight less useful. Collies and other working sheepdogs with the barking trait would have been crossed with any other breed that had other desirable traits, including size, stamina and a steady barking ability, as these are the traits that differentiate the huntaway from the heading dog today, but the exact lineage is not known.The earliest references to huntaways are in the late 19th century. A sheepdog trial with a specific class for huntaways was advertised in the Upper Waitaki in 1870. \"Wanted\" advertisements for \"huntaway sheepdogs\" were in the Otago Daily Times newspaper in 1884, heading and huntaway collies were advertised for sale in 1885.,The huntaway was further developed as a separate breed from the heading dog during the 20th century." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4a5" }, "breed": "Ibizan Hound", "origin": "Ibiza, (Balearic Islands, Spain)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibizan_Hound", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Podenco_z_ibizy_645.jpg/240px-Podenco_z_ibizy_645.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6a4" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/ibizan_hound.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 5, "shedding": 2, "grooming": 1, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 3, "energy": 5, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 11, "max_life_expectancy": 14, "max_height_male": 27.5, "max_height_female": 27.5, "max_weight_male": 50, "max_weight_female": 45, "min_height_male": 23.5, "min_height_female": 23.5, "min_weight_male": 50, "min_weight_female": 45, "breed": "Ibizan Hound" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5edf" }, "breed": "Ibizan Hound", "contenido": "The Ibizan Hound (Spanish: podenco ibicenco, Catalan: ca eivissenc) is a lean, agile dog of the hound family.

Though somewhat independent and stubborn at times, they do take well to training if positive methods are used, but they will balk at punitive training methods. They are generally quiet but will alarm bark if necessary, so they make good watch dogs. They are sensitive hounds, and very good around children and other dogs alike.

It is most commonly found in Morocco, which holds the standard under the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale. The Aidi is also found in Algeria, Tunisia and Libya. It possesses hunting capabilities and good scenting ability. In Morocco, it is often paired in hunting with the Sloughi, which chases down prey that the Aidi has located by scent.,The Aidi is native from the Atlas Mountains of North Africa. The dog has never worked as a sheepdog even though the 1963 standard was published under the name Atlas Sheepdog; this was corrected in 1969. A courageous dog, the Aidi lived and worked in the Atlas Mountains of North Africa, protecting his owner and property from wildcats, other predators, and strangers. This breed has also been called the Berber, after the Berber tribes who utilized it, and bears some resemblance to the Pariah dog who is believed to share its ancestry. As a protector of the desert nomad tribes, the most alert and aggressive dogs were staked around the perimeter of the camp at night. The Aidi has not been highly regarded by the tribes historically, as are most dogs other than the Sloughi and other breeds regarded as noble. However, Moroccans have recently formed a club to protect the purity of the breed which has contributed so much in so many roles, as protector, hunter, police dog, and pet. Although the Aidi has been used primarily as a working dog, he has become more common as a house dog in the country. This breed also makes a good urban pet if he is given tasks and exercise enough to keep him satisfied and happy.In color and flock guard work they share many characteristics of many livestock guardian dog breeds.,Standing 52\u201362 cm (20\u201324 in) in height and weighing around 55 pounds (25 kg), the Aidi's lean, muscular body is protected by a coarse, thick, weather-resistant coat with a heavy plumed tail.

They were used with varying success in the explorations of both poles, as well as during the Alaskan gold rush. Sled dog teams delivered mail to rural communities in Alaska, Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut. Sled dogs today are still used by some rural communities, especially in areas of Russia, Canada, and Alaska as well as much of Greenland.

The optimal maximum size for a sled dog is 20\u201325 kg (44\u201355 lb) based on thermo-regulation, and the ancient sled dogs were between 16 and 25 kg (35 and 55 lb). The same standard has been found in the remains of sled dogs from this region 2,000 years ago and in the modern Siberian Husky breed standard. Other dogs were more massive at 30 kg (66 lb) and appear to be dogs that had been crossed with wolves and used for polar bear hunting. At death, the heads of the dogs had been carefully separated from their bodies by humans and was thought to be for ceremonial reasons.The Kungur Chronicle and the Remezov Chronicle, created at the end of the 16th century and 1703 respectively, tells about the people living along Siberian rivers, whose primary means of transport was riding on reindeer or dogs. In these documents, the rivers Olenyok, Yana, Indigirka and Kolyma were called \u201cdog rivers\u201d, as they were rich in fish for the dogs to eat. Rivers where there is no fish or it is not enough to feed the dogs, reindeer are used for transportation, and such rivers were called \"deer rivers.\",From the 1940s to the 1990s, Russian dog sled numbers were in decline. Breed population reached an all-time low of 3000 in 1998 before revival efforts took off.

This breed is a medium-sized, short-coated dog that occurs in two main colour forms. It has either brown or black hair distributed fairly evenly through a white coat, which gives the appearance of a \"red\" or \"blue\" dog.,As with dogs from other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is energetic and intelligent with an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, particularly if it is interesting and challenging. It was originally bred to herd by biting, and is known to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be protective of them and their possessions. It is easy to groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 16 years.In the 19th century, New South Wales cattle farmer Thomas Hall crossed the dogs used by drovers in his parents' home county, Northumberland, with dingoes he had tamed. The resulting dogs were known as Halls Heelers. After Hall's death in 1870, the dogs became available beyond the Hall family and their associates. They were subsequently developed into two modern breeds: the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog. Robert Kaleski, who wrote the first standard for the breed, was influential in its development.,Australian Cattle Dog has been nicknamed a \"Red Heeler\" or \"Blue Heeler\" on the basis of its colouring and practice of moving reluctant cattle by nipping at their heels. Dogs from a line bred in Queensland, Australia, which were successful at shows and at stud in the 1940s, were called \"Queensland Heelers\" to differentiate them from lines bred in New South Wales; this nickname is now occasionally applied to any Australian Cattle Dog.,The Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, muscular, compact dog that gives the impression of agility and strength. It has a broad skull that flattens to a definite stop between the eyes, with muscular cheeks and a medium-length, deep, powerful muzzle. The ears are pricked, small to medium in size and set wide apart, with a covering of hair on the inside. The eyes are oval and dark, with an alert, keen expression. The neck and shoulders are strong and muscular; the forelegs are straight and parallel; and the feet round and arched, with small, sturdy toes and nails.The Australian Cattle Dog breed standard states that it should have well-conditioned muscles, even when bred for companion or show purposes, and that its appearance should be symmetrical and balanced, with no individual part of the dog exaggerated. It should not look either delicate or cumbersome, as either characteristic limits the agility and endurance that is necessary for a working dog.,The female Australian Cattle Dog measures approximately 43\u201348 centimetres (17\u201319 in) at the withers, and the male measures about 46\u201351 centimetres (18\u201320 in) at the withers. The dog should be longer than tall, that is, the length of the body from breast bone to buttocks is greater than the height at the withers, in a ratio of 10 to 9.

Originally used solely as a herding dog, the Australian Shepherd has become one of the most popular companion dog breeds in North America.,The Australian Shepherd descends in part from pastoral dogs brought to herd Spanish flocks in North America as early as the 1500s. There is some speculation that these dogs included the Carea Leon\u00e9s, a mountain sheepdog that can display the eye color and merle coat found in many contemporary Australian Shepherds.  It is sometimes claimed that the Basque Shepherd Dog and the Pyrenean Sheepdog were also among the ancestors of the breed.

The Australian Shepherd is believed to have developed from a variety of herding dogs imported to California with sheep imports, including collies from Australia and New Zealand, it was from these ancestors the breed took its name.The Australian Shepherd spread from California throughout the Western United States where it became extremely popular with ranchers who valued the breed\u2019s sheep working qualities, as well as their ability to handle cattle and other livestock. A purely working breed for over a century, the Australian Shepherd was virtually unknown outside of the livestock industry until the mid 20th century when the breed was popularised by Jay Lister, a rodeo performer, at rodeos across the western states with his Australian Shepherds performing all manner of tricks. A breed club was soon formed to promote the breed, the Australian Shepherd Club of America, and kennel club recognition followed in 1979 when the breed was recognised by the United Kennel Club. The breed was subsequently recognised by the American Kennel Club in the 1990s and later the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale.From the late-20th century the Australian Shepherd has increasingly been seen in conformation shows and it has become an extremely popular companion dog, in 2019 it was ranked by the American Kennel Club as the 15th most popular breed of dog in the United States.,The Australian Shepherd is a medium-sized, athletic breed; they typically stand between 18 and 23 inches (46 and 58 cm) and weigh between 35 and 70 pounds (16 and 32 kg). The United Kennel Club\u2019s breed standard states dogs should stand between 20 and 23 inches (51 and 58 cm) and bitches between 18 and 21 inches (46 and 53 cm); the standard does allow individual animals to exceed these limits slightly.The Australian Shepherd has a moderately long and wavy double coat that has a dense undercoat and coarse topcoat; the coat is short on the face and well feathered on the rear of the legs. The breed is known for its unique colorations and variable coat patterns, it being said no two dogs sharing a coat. The breed standard allows for blue merle, red merle, solid black or solid red, with or without white markings and with or without tan points.Examples of the breed can be born with long or naturally bobbed (short) tails; traditionally long tailed dogs had their tails docked, although the modern breed standard allows for long tailed dogs." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c411" }, "breed": "Austrian Black and Tan Hound", "origin": "Austria", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Black_and_Tan_Hound", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Brandlbracke.JPG/220px-Brandlbracke.JPG", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5dff" }, "breed": "Austrian Black and Tan Hound", "contenido": "The Austrian Black and Tan Hound is a breed of dog originating in Austria.,There is no known history of the Austrian Black and Tan Hound until after the middle of the 19th century.

The beagle was developed primarily for hunting hare (beagling). Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts, the beagle is the primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is intelligent. It is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems.,The modern breed was developed in Great Britain around the 1830s from several breeds, including the Talbot Hound, the North Country Beagle, the Southern Hound, and possibly the Harrier.,Beagles have been depicted in popular culture since Elizabethan times in literature and paintings, and more recently in film, television, and comic books.,The origin of the beagle is not known. In the 11th century, William the Conqueror brought the St. Hubert Hound and the Talbot hound to Britain. In Britain, both of these strains were then crossed with Greyhounds to give them speed and stamina for deer hunting. Beagles are similar to the Harrier and the extinct Southern Hound, though they are smaller and slower.,From medieval times, beagle was used as a generic description for the smaller hounds, though these dogs differed considerably from the modern breed. Miniature breeds of beagle-type dogs were known from the times of Edward II and Henry VII, who both had packs of Glove Beagles, so named since they were small enough to fit on a glove, and Queen Elizabeth I kept a breed known as a Pocket Beagle, which stood 8 to 9 inches (20 to 23 cm) at the shoulder. Small enough to fit in a \"pocket\" or saddlebag, they rode along on the hunt. The larger hounds would run the prey to ground, then the hunters would release the small dogs to continue the chase through underbrush. Elizabeth I referred to the dogs as her singing beagles and often entertained guests at her royal table by letting her Pocket Beagles cavort amid their plates and cups. 19th-century sources refer to these breeds interchangeably and it is possible that the two names refer to the same small variety. In George Jesse's Researches into the History of the British Dog from 1866, the early 17th-century poet and writer Gervase Markham is quoted referring to the beagle as small enough to sit on a man's hand and to the: little small mitten-beagle, which may be companion for a ladies kirtle, and in the field will run as cunningly as any hound whatere, only their musick is very small like reeds. Standards for the Pocket Beagle were drawn up as late as 1901; these genetic lines are now extinct, although modern breeders have attempted to recreate the variety.,By the 18th century, two breeds had been developed for hunting hare and rabbit: the Southern Hound and the North Country Beagle (or Northern Hound). The Southern Hound, a tall, heavy dog with a square head, and long, soft ears, was common from south of the River Trent and probably closely related to the Talbot Hound. Though slow, it had stamina and an excellent scenting ability. The North Country Beagle, possibly a cross between an offshoot of the Talbot stock and a Greyhound, was bred chiefly in Yorkshire and was common in the northern counties. It was smaller than the Southern Hound, less heavy-set, and with a more pointed muzzle. It was faster than its southern counterpart but its scenting abilities were less well-developed.,Reverend Phillip Honeywood established a beagle pack in Essex in the 1830s and it is believed that this pack formed the basis for the modern breed. Although details of the pack's lineage are not recorded, it is thought that North Country Beagles and Southern Hounds were strongly represented; William Youatt suspected that Harriers formed a good majority of the beagle's bloodline, but the origin of the Harrier is itself obscure. Honeywood's Beagles were small, standing at about 10 inches (25 cm) at the shoulder, and pure white according to John Mills (writing in The Sportsman's Library in 1845). Prince Albert and Lord Winterton also had Beagle packs around this time, and royal favor no doubt led to some revival of interest in the breed, but Honeywood's pack was regarded as the finest of the three." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c422" }, "breed": "Beauceron", "origin": "France", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauceron", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Owczarek_francuski_beauceron_009pl.jpg/220px-Owczarek_francuski_beauceron_009pl.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c660" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/beauceron.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 4, "grooming": 3, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 2, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 4, "trainability": 3, "energy": 5, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 12, "max_height_male": 27.5, "max_height_female": 27.5, "max_weight_male": 110, "max_weight_female": 110, "min_height_male": 25.5, "min_height_female": 25.5, "min_weight_male": 70, "min_weight_female": 70, "breed": "Beauceron" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e10" }, "breed": "Beauceron", "contenido": "The Beauceron is a herding dog breed originating from the plains of Central France.

Originally bred to hunt, the Bedlington Terrier has since been used in dog racing, numerous dog sports, as well as in conformation shows and as a companion dog. It is closely related to the Dandie Dinmont Terrier, Whippet and Otterhound.,It is described as a very versatile yet contradictory dog. They have powerful swimming skills, comparable to those of water dogs such as the Newfoundland, and are noted for being very quick and having high endurance. They love snow, and can achieve a Husky-like turn of speed on ice or in deep powder, using their powerful noses as a plough. Bedlingtons are noted for their similarity in appearance to lambs. The dogs have blue, liver or sandy colouration, all three of which may have tan points. Their fur forms a distinctive top knot on the dog's head. It is nonshedding and with minimal odor but needs weekly grooming to remove dead hair.Originally known as the Rothbury or Rodbury Terrier, the name Bedlington Terrier was not applied to the breed until 1825, but some dogs have pedigrees that can be traced back as far as 1782. The first dog show with a class for Bedlington Terriers was held in 1870 at Bedlington. Bedlington Terriers shown at early shows were frequently dyed to improve the look of their fur. In 1948, a Bedlington Terrier known as Rock Ridge Night Rocket won best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. The breed has a high incidence of copper toxicosis, but with the exception of eye problems, it is mostly free from health complaints.,The Bedlington Terrier has been described as resembling a lamb. It has also been compared to a miniature version of the Scottish Deerhound. George Shields stated that exceedingly well-bred dogs possess the spirit of a thoroughbred racehorse.The dogs have blue, liver or sandy colouration, all three of which may have tan points. Bedlingtons carry what is known as the greying gene, a dominant trait carried on the G locus. This gene causes puppies born with black or dark brown fur to lighten to grey or liver with age. The fur of the Bedlington creates a shape on the top of the dog's head known as a topknot. Although most modern breed standards call for the dog's topknot to be lighter than its body, when the breed was first being formed there was at least one prominent breeder, Mr. Pickett, who believed that the topknot should be darker, not lighter.The dog's coat has been described as shaggy, hard, and rugged in style and it has also been described as linty in texture, giving the breed the nickname of \"linty-haired terrier\". Its coat is made up of a combination of hard and soft hairs. It is extremely difficult to maintain a \"show clip\", even for professionals, and grooming can be quite expensive. Dogs in what is referred to as show clip, or groomed for the show ring, cannot have fur that stands out more than 1 inch (2.5 centimetres) from their body, and the coat must have a \"crisp\" texture. If grooming is not performed regularly, the coat's condition rapidly deteriorates. For that reason, most Bedlingtons that are kept strictly as pets keep a lower maintenance \"pet groom\" style. Bedlington Terriers \u2014like Poodles\u2014 have been referred to as a nonshedding, hypoallergenic breed. They have minimal dog odor as long as their coat and ears are healthy and their coat is groomed regularly to remove dead hair. Bedlingtons like the groomer and are cooperative under clip.The head of the dog must be rounded in shape with no stop. Their eyes are almond-shaped and small, and the lips are close-fitting and lack flews. The back must be arched, and the body should be slightly longer in length than in height. Although 16.5 inches (42 cm) is the preferred height for male dogs, a range from 16 to 17.5 inches (41 to 44 cm) is allowed; for females, the preferred height is 15.5 inches (39 cm) and the acceptable range is from 15 to 16.5 inches (38 to 42 cm). Both genders must weigh between 17 and 23 pounds (7.7 and 10.4 kg). They possess a light, springy gait.,Bedlingtons are sharp and plucky. Their bark has been called hound-like and has been compared to the firing of a machine gun. A fast dog with high endurance, the Bedlington Terrier is just as quick in water as it is on land, and their swimming speed rivals that of the Newfoundland. Bedlington Terriers \"have pace enough to keep up with the ordinary speed of a horse.\" Because of the Whippet in their lineage, they have a tendency to bolt. Their versatility has been praised, with some dogs willing to \"[be] a house-dog, a gun-dog, a rat-dog, a badger-dog, or, if needed, [to] bolt a fox...\"They are also known for their intelligence and tenacity when it comes to taking on vermin. Bedlingtons are quite fond of fighting, and are prone to jealousy when around other dogs. One man stated that \"this dog was about fit to kill any other dog of his weight\" and compared him to the fighting dogs used in dog fighting. They have also been used in dog fighting." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c428" }, "breed": "Black Russian Terrier", "origin": "Russia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Russian_Terrier", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Russianblack.jpg/220px-Russianblack.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c664" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/black_russian_terrier.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 4, "drooling": 3, "coat_length": 2, "good_with_strangers": 2, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 5, "trainability": 4, "energy": 4, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 12, "max_height_male": 30, "max_height_female": 30, "max_weight_male": 130, "max_weight_female": 130, "min_height_male": 27, "min_height_female": 27, "min_weight_male": 80, "min_weight_female": 80, "breed": "Black Russian Terrier" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e1b" }, "breed": "Black Russian Terrier", "contenido": "The Black Russian Terrier (Russian: \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0447\u0451\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0440), also known as the Chornyi Terrier (chornyi being Russian for black) is a breed of dog created in USSR in Red Star (Krasnaya Zvezda) Kennel during the late 1940s and the early 1950s for use as military/working dogs. At the present time, the Black Russian Terrier is a breed recognized by the FCI (FCI's from September 1983), AKC (AKC's from July 2004), CKC, KC, ANKC, NZKC and other cynological organizations. The contemporary Black Russian Terrier is a working dog, guarding dog, sporting and companion dog.,Despite its name, the Black Russian Terrier is not a true terrier: it is believed that about seventeen breeds were used in its development, including the Airedale, the Giant Schnauzer, the Rottweiler, the Newfoundland, the Caucasian Shepherd Dog and other breeds.,The Black Russian Terrier was developed in the former USSR in Red Star (Krasnaya Zvezda) Kennel by the state for use as a military/working dogs. The breeding stock was largely imported from countries where the Red Army was active during the Second World War, especially East Germany. Breeds used in the development include the Giant Schnauzer, Airedale Terrier, Rottweiler, Newfoundland, Caucasian Shepherd Dog and other breeds. The Black Russian Terrier was bred for working ability, rather than appearance, and early examples only resembled today's Black Russian Terrier in their build and coat type. They were bred solely by the state owned Red Star Kennel in Moscow until 1957, when some puppies were sold to civilian breeders. These breeders began to breed for looks (as the original was rather plain) while retaining working ability. In time, the breed spread to the other parts of USSR like Saint Petersburg, Siberia, Ukraine and later to the first European country Finland and next to the other European countries: Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Germany and finally to the United States, Canada, Australia and others.,In 1955 the first working examples of the breed were put on show at an exhibition in Moscow and the first Breed Standard was published in 1958, which was then adopted by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 1984. In 1996 The Russian Federation Working Dog-breeders & Russian Kynological Federation (RKF) adopted a second Standard for the breed more in line to the modern day Russian Black Terrier. And it was also in 1996 that the breed was first introduced into the UK. In 1998 The Kennel Club added the Russian Black Terrier to the Import Register.,The coat is a double coat with a coarse outer guard hair over a softer undercoat.

Similar to the Picardy Spaniel, it has a distinctive coloured coat. Recognised by only a handful of kennel associations, the breed is predominantly known in France and Canada.,A Blue Picardy Spaniel on average is around 22\u201324 inches (56\u201361 cm) high at the withers and weighs 43\u201345 pounds (20\u201320 kg).

It has long legs with some setter characteristics.It has a long broad nose and muzzle, with thick ears covered in silky hair that usually end around the tip of the muzzle. Its chest is of medium size that descends down to the same level as the elbows. Both the forequarters and the hindquarters are well muscled. Its tail typically does not extend beyond the hock and is normally straight.The breed has many similarities with the Picardy Spaniel due to the two breeds' recent history. The Blue Spaniel is described as being softer, as well as the obvious difference in coat color. The Picardy has a brown coat whereas the Blue Picardy has a black and grey coat, which was brought into the breed by the introduction of English Setter blood. Similar in the modern era due to the close similarities of the two different breed standards. In addition, the Blue Picardy is a little faster, and has a slightly finer nose.,It is a versatile hunting dog, used for its ability to locate and retrieve game in harsh and adverse terrain and conditions. It is not specialised to any one type of terrain, and tends to score well in field trials. The Blue Picardy is considered to be a quiet breed, but requires a great deal of exercise as it has a high level of stamina. It loves to play, and is a responsive and obedient breed which thrives on human companionship.

This \"American Gentleman\" was accepted in 1893 by the American Kennel Club as a non-sporting breed. Color and markings are important when distinguishing this breed from the AKC standard. They should be either black, brindle or seal with white markings. Boston Terriers are small and compact with a short tail and erect ears. The AKC says they are highly intelligent and very easily trained. They are friendly and can be stubborn at times. The average life span of a Boston Terrier is around 11 to 13 years.The American Kennel Club ranked the Boston Terrier as the 21st most popular breed in 2019.,The Boston terrier breed originated around 1875, when Robert C. Hooper of Boston purchased from Edward Burnett a dog named Judge (known later as Hooper's Judge), which was of a bull and terrier type lineage. Hooper's Judge is directly related to the original bull and terrier breeds of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The American Kennel Club cites Hooper's Judge as the ancestor of all true modern Boston Terriers.Judge weighed about 32 pounds (15 kg). Judge was bred to Burnett's Gyp (or Kate).  Gyp was a white bulldog-type female, owned by Mr. Edward Burnett, of Southboro, MA. She weighed about 20 pounds, was stocky and strong and had the typical blocky head now shown in Bostons. From this foundation of the breed, subsequent breeders refined the breed into what we know of it today.  Bred down in size from fighting dogs of the bull and terrier types, the Boston Terrier originally weighed up to 44 pounds (20 kg) (Old Boston Bulldogs). ,The breed was first shown in Boston in 1870. By 1889 the breed had become sufficiently popular in Boston that fanciers formed the American Bull Terrier Club, the breed's nickname, \"roundheads\". Shortly after, at the suggestion of James Watson (a noted writer and authority), the club changed its name to the Boston Terrier Club and in 1893 it was admitted to membership in the American Kennel Club, thus making it the first US breed to be recognized. It is one of a small number of breeds to have originated in the United States. The Boston Terrier was the first non-sporting dog breed in the US.,In the early years, the color and markings were not very important. By the 20th century the breed's distinctive markings and color were written into the standard, becoming an essential feature. The Boston Terrier has lost most of its aggressive nature, preferring the company of humans, although some males will still challenge other dogs if they feel their territory is being invaded. ,Boston University has used Rhett the Boston Terrier as their mascot since 1922. Wofford College in Spartanburg, SC has had a live Boston Terrier mascot named Blitz since 2003 that attends home football games. The Boston Terrier has also been the official state dog of Massachusetts since 1979. ,The Boston Terrier is a compactly built, well-proportioned dog. It has a square-looking head with erect ears and a slightly arched neck. The muzzle is short and generally wrinkle-free, with an even or a slightly undershot bite. The chest is broad and the tail is short. According to international breed standards, the dog should weigh no more than 25 pounds (11 kg). Boston Terriers usually stand up to 15-17 inches at the withers.The American Kennel Club divides the breed into three classes: under 15 pounds, 15 pounds and under 20 pounds, 20 pounds and not exceeding 25 pounds." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c437" }, "breed": "Braque Francais", "origin": "France", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braque_Francais", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/0805_braque_francais_text.jpg/220px-0805_braque_francais_text.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e31" }, "breed": "Braque Francais", "contenido": "The Braques fran\u00e7ais are hunting dogs, from a very old type of gun dog used for pointing the location of game birds for a hunter.

Over the centuries the dogs were taken to other countries and were crossed with other breeds. When a search was made at the end of the nineteenth century to find the original dogs, two separate regional varieties were found.The first breed club was formed in 1850, and the standards for both breeds were written in 1880.

Of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world, only the Canadian Kennel Club in Canada and the United Kennel Club in the U.S. recognise them. The Canadian Kennel Club recognises one breed, the Braque Fran\u00e7ais (Gascogne) in its Sporting Dogs Group and the United Kennel Club recognises both breeds, in its Gundog Group, with the names Braque Fran\u00e7ais De Grande Taille and Braque Fran\u00e7ais, De Petite Taille - petite taille (smaller size) means the Pyrenean is smaller than the Gascogne, and does not mean that it is a little dog.,The Braque fran\u00e7ais breeds are not just pointers, but versatile hunting dogs that can retrieve, flush, and even trail game in all sorts of terrain. The Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es is a quick dog that can move fast without sprinting, while the Gascogne is a slower moving dog.,Both breeds of Braque fran\u00e7ais are of medium to large size, with long legs and long drop ears. The coat is short, and chestnut brown or white speckled with brown in colour, often with one or more large brown spots. The head is usually brown.

It was in the past also known as the Chien de Berger fran\u00e7ais de Plaine.,The Briard originated in, and is named for, the Brie historic region of north-central France, where it was traditionally used both for herding sheep and to defend them.:\u200a287\u200a The first written mention of the shepherd dogs of Brie is thought to be in the Cours complet d'agriculture of Jean-Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Rozier,:\u200a41\u200a who in 1783 wrote that the \"chien de Brie\" was long-haired and usually black; that in the open plains there was little danger from wolves, and so the dogs were used more for herding than for defence; and that shepherd dogs had the task of preventing the sheep from straying into crops or vineyards where they might cause damage.:\u200a287\u200a Pierre M\u00e9gnin, writing in 1895, clearly distinguishes the short-haired Chien de Beauce \u2013 the modern Beauceron \u2013 from the long-haired Chien de Brie or Briard.:\u200a41\u200a:\u200a292\u200a In 1896 M\u00e9gnin was among those who founded the Club des chiens de berger fran\u00e7ais.:\u200a42\u200aThe Berger de Brie was first shown at the first Paris dog show in 1863, where a bitch named Charmant took a prize. The first Briard to be registered in the Livre des Origines Fran\u00e7aises, the national stud-book, was Sans G\u00eane, winner of a gold medal at the Paris show in 1885.:\u200a42\u200a A breed standard was established in 1897, in which two varieties were described: one with a woolly or sheep-like coat, the other with a coat more similar to that of the goat; the woolly type later disappeared. In 1909 a breed society, Les Amis du Briard, was formed.:\u200a42\u200aBreed numbers fell during the First World War; any dog thought suitable for military use was sent to the front. The breed society resumed its activities in 1923, and a rival breed association was formed at about the same time; in 1935 this last organised the first single-breed show for the Berger de Brie, with seventy-eight participants.:\u200a42\u200a Numbers again fell sharply under the Nazi occupation of France during the Second World War. After the war the two breed clubs merged under the name Club des Amis du Briard.:\u200a42\u200aIn 1954 the Berger de Brie was fully recognised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale.Partly as a consequence of the mechanisation of agriculture and resulting rural depopulation of the post-War years, the Berger de Brie came to be commonly kept as a companion dog. In the 1970s and 1980s its numbers increased substantially: annual registrations in the Livre des Origines Fran\u00e7aises rose from 317 in 1970 to 905 in 1975, to 4101 in 1980 and then to a peak of 6364 in 1986, after which they fell precipitously; at one point the breed club had over 6000 members, more than any other French breed association at any time.:\u200a44\u200a Disagreements within the association resulted in its expulsion from the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Centrale Canine; a new breed society, the Association du Berger de Brie, was recognised in 1989.:\u200a45\u200a In 1996 ten European breed associations in nine different countries joined to form the Union Europ\u00e9enne du Berger de Brie.:\u200a45\u200aIn 2001, blindness caused by a disease similar to Leber congenital amaurosis was partially reversed in three Briard puppies by researchers at Cornell University and the University of Pennsylvania using gene therapy.,The coat is long (no less than 7 cm), thick and harsh like that of a goat; it may be solid black, grey, blue or fawn, or fawn overlaid with black; greying is seen to a variable extent. Dogs stand 62\u201368 cm at the withers, bitches about 56\u201364 cm.

The Griffon Bruxellois may refer to three different breeds, the Griffon Bruxellois, the Griffon Belge and the Petit Braban\u00e7on. Identical in standard except for coat and colour differences, in some standards they are considered varieties of the same breed, much like Belgian Shepherd Dogs.,The three variations of this dog, the Brussels Griffon (Griffon Bruxellois), the Belgian Griffon (Griffon Belge), and the Petit Braban\u00e7on, all descend from dog called a Smousje, a rough coated, small terrier-like dog kept in stables to eliminate rodents, similar to the Dutch Smoushond.  The little coarse-haired dog in the foreground of the Jan van Eyck painting The Arnolfini Marriage is thought to be an early form of this breed.  In Belgium coachmen were fond of their alert little Griffons d\u2019Ecurie (wiry coated stable dogs) and in the 19th century, they bred their Griffons with imported toy dogs. Breeding with the Pug and King Charles Spaniel brought about the current breed type, but also brought the short black coat that led to the Petits Braban\u00e7on, which was originally a fault in the breed. The spaniels also brought the rich red and black and tan colour of the modern Griffon Bruxellois and Griffon Belge.The Griffon Bruxellois grew in popularity in the late 19th century with both workers and noblemen in Belgium. The first Griffon Bruxellois was registered in 1883 in the first volume Belgium's kennel club studbook, the Livre des Origines Saint-Hubert (LOSH). The popularity of the breed was increased by the interest of Queen Marie Henriette, a dog enthusiast who visited the annual dog shows in Belgium religiously, often with her daughter, and became a breeder and booster of Griffon Bruxellois, giving them international fame and popularity. Many dogs were exported to other countries, leading to Griffon Bruxellois clubs in England (1897) and Brussels Griffon clubs in the U.S. (1945.)The First World War and Second World War proved to be a disastrous time for the breed. Wars are difficult on any dog breed, and the recovering numbers after the First World War were set back by increased vigilance in breeding away from faults such as webbed toes. By the end of the Second World War, Belgium had almost no native Griffon Bruxellois left, and it was only through the vigilance of dedicated breeders (in the U.K. particularly) that the breed survived at all.,The breed has never been numerous or popular, but had a brief vogue in the late 1950s, and now is generally an uncommon breed. There has been a recent increase in interest in the United States due to the appearance of a Griffon in the movie, As Good as It Gets, and also because of a general increase in interest in toy dogs.,The Brussels Griffon is typically a small breed with a sturdy frame.  The average adult Griffon stands from 9 to 11 inches (230\u2013280 mm) tall, and weighs 8 to 10 pounds (4\u20135 kg).  They have domed heads, short noses, and an underbite.  Their human-like facial features were the inspiration for the Ewok.The Griffon comes in two coat variants, wiry/rough and smooth coat.  Their hair (not fur) can be red, black and tan, or black and reddish in color.  The short hair Griffon requires little grooming while the wiry/rough coat Griffon requires weekly grooming attention.Generally, breeders will dock tails and crop ears on puppies for sale. This practice is illegal in most of Europe and increasingly frowned on in the United States, but still practiced in some places.,The Griffon Bruxellois is known to have a huge heart, and a strong desire to snuggle and be with its master. They display a visible air of self-importance. A Griffon should not be shy or aggressive, but they are very emotionally sensitive, and because of this, should be socialized carefully at a young age. Griffons should also be alert, inquisitive and interested in their surroundings." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c43b" }, "breed": "Bucovina Shepherd Dog", "origin": "Romania (Southeastern Europe)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucovina_Shepherd_Dog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Bucovina_Sheepdog.jpg/220px-Bucovina_Sheepdog.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e3c" }, "breed": "Bucovina Shepherd Dog", "contenido": "The Romanian Bucovina Shepherd (Romanian: Ciob\u0103nesc Rom\u00e2nesc de Bucovina) is a breed  of livestock guardian dogs native to historical Bukovina (Bucovina) region.

The Canadian Kennel Club registers approximately 350.:\u200a4\u20135\u200a,The Chow Chow is a sturdily built dog, square in profile, with a broad skull and small, triangular, erect ears with rounded tips. The breed is known for a very dense double coat that is either smooth or rough.:\u200a4\u20135\u200a The fur is particularly thick in the neck area, giving it a distinctive ruff or mane appearance. The coat may be shaded/self-red, black, blue, cinnamon/fawn, or cream.:\u200a4\u20135\u200a,Not all these color varieties are recognized as valid in all countries. Individuals with patchy or multicolored coats are considered to be outside the breed standard.  ,Chow Chow eyes are typically deep set and almond shaped. The breed is unique by their purple/blue-black tongue which no other breed has except Shar Pei, and has very straight hind legs, resulting in a rather stilted gait.:\u200a4\u20135\u200a The bluish color extends to the Chow Chow's lips; this is the only dog breed with this distinctive bluish color in its lips and oral cavity (other dogs have black or a piebald pattern skin in their mouths).:\u200a4\u20135\u200a Another distinctive feature is the curly tail.:\u200a4\u20135\u200a It has thick hair and lies curled on its back. The nose should be black, but blue-coated Chow Chow can have a solid blue or slate-colored nose. According to the American Kennel Club breed standards, any other tone is not acceptable for contests. FCI countries, however, do allow a self-colored nose in the cream.The blue-black/purple tongue gene appears to be dominant, as most mixed breed dogs that come from a Chow Chow retain that tongue color. However, the blue-black/purple tongue can also be found on the Shar Pei. This is not to say that every mixed breed dog with spots of purple on the tongue is descended from Chow Chow, as purple spots on the tongue can be found on other purebred dogs.,The distinctive Chow Chow features" }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c45c" }, "breed": "Clumber Spaniel", "origin": "England", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clumber_Spaniel", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Clumber_spaniel_rybnik_kamien_pppl.jpg/220px-Clumber_spaniel_rybnik_kamien_pppl.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c682" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/clumber_spaniel.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 4, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 4, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 4, "energy": 3, "barking": 1, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 12, "max_height_male": 20, "max_height_female": 20, "max_weight_male": 85, "max_weight_female": 70, "min_height_male": 18, "min_height_female": 18, "min_weight_male": 70, "min_weight_female": 55, "breed": "Clumber Spaniel" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e6d" }, "breed": "Clumber Spaniel", "contenido": "The Clumber Spaniel is a breed of dog of the spaniel type, developed in the United Kingdom. It is the largest of the spaniels, and comes in predominantly white with either lemon or orange markings. The name of the breed is taken from Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire where the breed was first developed. It is a gundog that specialises in hunting in heavy cover. They are gentle and loyal, and can act aloof with strangers. They have several habits which could be considered disadvantages, including a constant shedding of its coat and snoring.,The history of the breed is uncertain prior to the mid-19th century with two theories being prevalent. Clumber Spaniels have been kept and bred by various members of the British Royal Family, including Prince Albert, King Edward VII and King George V. They were introduced into Canada in 1844, and in 1884 became one of the first ten breeds recognised by the American Kennel Club. The breed can suffer from a variety of breed-specific ailments varying in severity from temporary lameness due to bone growth whilst young to hip dysplasia or spinal disc herniation.,The Clumber Spaniel is the largest of the spaniels, and is long and heavy-bodied, standing only 17 to 20 inches (43 to 51 cm) in height but weighing from 55 to 85 pounds (25 to 39 kg). It is similar in shape to the smaller Sussex Spaniel. The Clumber has a heavy bone structure, has a massive 'melting' head with a mournful and dopey expression, a square nose and muzzle, and large vine-leaf shaped ears. Freckles on the muzzle and front legs are common. Its coat is dense, weather-resistant, straight, and flat with feathering around the ears, belly and legs. Clumbers are predominantly white in colour with lemon, brown, or orange markings around the eyes, and at the base of the tail.,Their temperament is described as gentle, loyal and affectionate, but dignified and aloof with strangers. They can appear to be a sedate breed and enjoy curling up on the couch, eating and sleeping.Clumber Spaniels shed at a medium pace and require to be brushed and groomed frequently. Clumbers tend to drool because of their very droopy flews. Clumbers have minds of their own. Puppies are especially curious and playful. The breed has a trophy mentality and the dog has an incessant need to carry something most of the time; unfortunately this can lead to health issues as they may ingest the items. Clumber Spaniels have the tendency to be more reserved with other dogs, until they have warmed up to them.,The breed has been used to hunt pheasant and partridge, in both small packs and alone. It is well-suited for work in upland hunting in dense cover, and although the Clumber is rather slow in the field compared to other spaniels, it is a quiet worker with a fine nose and good stamina. The broad muzzle of the breed allows it to retrieve a variety of game. Clumber Spaniels can be very content indoors or out, but mostly wherever their owner is, is where they seem most pleased. Clumber Spaniels do not have a frequency to bark and are more considered companions in the home rather than a watch dog." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c45e" }, "breed": "Cursinu", "origin": "Corsica (France)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursinu", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Cursinu_1.jpg/220px-Cursinu_1.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e77" }, "breed": "Cursinu", "contenido": "The Corsican Dog (chien corse) or Cursinu, is a breed of dog originating from Corsica.

Originating as a hunting dog, it was also used as a carriage dog in its early days. The origins of this breed can be traced back to present-day Croatia and its historical region of Dalmatia. It is thought that early ancestors of the breed were certain breeds of pointers and a spotted Great Dane. Today, it is a popular family pet and many dog enthusiasts enter Dalmatians into kennel club competitions.,The Dalmatian is a medium-sized, well-defined, muscular dog with excellent endurance and stamina. When fully grown, according to the American Kennel Club (AKC) breed standard, it stands from 19 to 23 inches (48 to 58 cm) tall. Both the AKC and The Kennel Club in the UK allow height up to 24 inches (61 cm) but that is not ideal. The outline of the dog should be square when viewed from the side: the body is as long from fore-chest to buttocks as it is tall at the withers, the shoulders are well laid back, the stifle is well bent and the hocks are well let down. The Dalmatian's feet are round with well-arched toes, and the nails are usually white or the same color as the dog's spots. The thin ears taper towards the tip and are set fairly high and close to the head. Accepted eye color varies between brown, amber, or blue, with some dogs having one blue eye and one brown eye.,Dalmatian puppies are born with plain white coats and their first spots usually appear within 10 days; however, spots may be visible on their skin from birth. They continue to develop until the dog is around 18 months old. Spots usually range in size from 2 to 6 cm (1.25 to 2.5 in), and are most commonly black or liver (brown) on a white background. Liver is the recessive colour in dalmatians, meaning that both parents have to \"carry\" the liver gene to produce this colour of pups. If both parents are liver, then all puppies will be liver-spotted. A dog who is dominate black is defined as being BB, a dog who is black spotted but carries liver is Bb and a liver dog is bb. Black spotted dogs always have black noses, and liver spotted dogs always have brown noses.,Other colors that occur occasionally but are not desired include blue (a blue-grayish color), brindle, mosaic, orange or lemon (dark to pale yellow), or tricolored (with black, brown & orange/lemon spots), as none are within breed standards. Orange and lemon occur the most frequently, especially in America, and are dilutes of the standard colours. They are defined as orange or lemon depending on their nose colour.,Another coloration fault is a larger solid patch of color, which appears anywhere on the body, but most often on the head, ears, or tail.  Patches are visible at birth and are not a group of connected spots; they are identifiable by the smooth edge of the patch, and that they have no interlacing white hairs in them.The Dalmatian coat is usually short, fine, and dense; however, smooth-coated Dalmatians occasionally produce long-coated offspring. Long-coated Dalmatians are not acceptable in the breed standard, but these individuals experience much less shedding than their smooth-coated counterparts, which shed considerably year-round. The standard variety's short, stiff hairs often weave into carpet, clothing, upholstery, and nearly any other kind of fabric and can be difficult to remove. Weekly grooming with a hound mitt or currycomb can lessen the amount of hair Dalmatians shed, although nothing can completely prevent shedding. Due to the minimal amount of oil in their coats, Dalmatians lack a dog odor (\"dog smell\") and stay fairly clean relative to many other dog breeds.Low uric acid (LUA) Dalmatians typically have smaller spots, which do not have as strong a pigment as standard Dalmatians. LUA breeders are trying to deal with this aspect, but it still remains possible to be able to pick a LUA out in a line up." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c46c" }, "breed": "Ecuadorian Hairless Dog", "origin": null, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuadorian_Hairless_Dog", "img": "Not available", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e94" }, "breed": "Ecuadorian Hairless Dog", "contenido": "A hairless dog is a dog with a genetic disposition for hairlessness and hair loss. There are two known types of genetic hairlessness, a dominant and a recessive type. The dominant type is caused by ectodermal dysplasia as a result of a mutation in the FOXI3 autosomal gene.,Dogs with dominant genes for hairlessness can pass their attributes to their offspring in natural conditions; that is, not under the control of humans. Therefore, it is possible that, in some parts of the world, groups of hairless dogs came into existence without human intervention. Later in history, people developed these groups into recognized breeds.,Worldwide recognized breeds at this time are the Chinese Crested Dog, the Xoloitzcuintle (Mexican Hairless Dog), the Peruvian Inca Orchid and the American Hairless Terrier.,The Argentine pila dog, the Bolivian Hairless Dog, and the Ecuadorian Hairless Dog are not registered hairless dog breeds.,Other breeds that were said to have existed in the past were the African hairless dog (also known as the Abyssinian sand terrier, Egyptian hairless dog and African elephant dog, the last being a reference to its grey skin) and the Siamese Hairless Dog.This type of genetic structure is said to be homozygous pre-natal lethal for the dominant gene. This means that zygotes with two dominant genes cannot live. Therefore, all dominant-hairless dogs have a heterozygous gene structure. This allows a homozygous recessive type to persist, which is the coated variety.,For dogs where hairlessness is a dominant gene, hairless to hairless matings will on average produce 66.6% hairless and 33.3% coated puppies. For hairless to coated matings, there will be an average of 50%/50% coated to hairless ratio, while for coated to coated matings, all puppies will be coated.The Chinese Crested Dog's coated variety is called a \"Powderpuff\" and is a recognized type. The coated variety of the Xoloitzcuintle is recognized as a valid type for conformation showing with some registries, including the AKC.

It is an affectionate, excitable breed with a typical lifespan of twelve to fourteen years. They are very similar to the Welsh Springer Spaniel and are descended from the Norfolk or Shropshire Spaniels of the mid-19th century; the breed has diverged into separate show and working lines. The breed suffers from average health complaints. The show-bred version of the breed has been linked to \"rage syndrome\", although the disorder is very rare. It is closely related to the Welsh Springer Spaniel and very closely to the English Cocker Spaniel; less than a century ago, springers and cockers would come from the same litter. The smaller \"cockers\" hunted woodcock while the larger littermates were used to flush, or \"spring\", game. In 1902, The Kennel Club recognized the English Springer Spaniel as a distinct breed. They are used as sniffer dogs on a widespread basis. The term Springer comes from the historic hunting role, where the dog would flush (spring) birds into the air.  ,The English Springer Spaniel is a medium-sized compact dog. Its coat is moderately long with feathering on the legs and tail. It is a well proportioned, balanced dog with a gentle expression and a friendly wagging tail. This breed represents perhaps the greatest divergence between working and show lines of any breed of dog. A field-bred dog and a show-bred dog appear to be different breeds but are registered together. The gene pools are almost completely segregated and have been for at least 70 years. A field-bred dog would not be competitive in a modern dog show, while a show dog would not have the speed or stamina to succeed in a field trial.The English Springer Spaniel field-bred dogs tend to have shorter, coarser coats than show-bred dogs. The ears are less pendulous. Field-bred dogs are wiry and have more of a feral look than those bred for showing. The tail of the field-bred dog may be docked a few inches in comparison to the show dog.  Field-bred dogs are selected for their sense of smell, hunting ability, and response to training rather than appearance.Show dogs have longer fur and more pendant ears, dewlaps and dangling flews. The tail is docked to a short stub in those countries that permit docking. They are generally more thickly boned and heavier than field-bred springers.The English Springer Spaniel is similar to the English Cocker Spaniel and at first glance, the only major difference is the latter's smaller size. However English Springers also tend to have shorter, and higher-set ears than English Cockers. Springers also tend to have a longer muzzle; their eyes are not as prominent, and the coat is less abundant. The major differences between the Welsh Springer and the English Springer are that the Welsh have more limited colors and tend to be slightly smaller.,Field-bred dogs tend to have shorter, coarser coats than the longer furred show-bred dogs. They normally only shed in summer and spring months but shed occasionally in the autumn. The coat comes in black or liver (dark brown) with white markings or predominantly white with black or liver markings; Tricolour: black and white or liver and white with tan markings, usually found on eyebrows, cheeks, inside of ears and under the tail. Any white portion of the coat may be flecked with ticking.,Males in the show dog line are typically approximately 19 to 21 inches (48 to 53 cm) at the withers and weigh 40 to 60 lb (18 to 27 kg). According to the UK Breed Standard, the English Springer Spaniel should be 20 inches (51 cm) at the withers. The females should be 18 to 20 inches (46 to 51 cm) and usually 35 to 55 lb (16 to 25 kg).

In September 2019, the FCI officially recognized the breed.,The Estonian Hound is a relatively young breed that is already highly valued in Estonia, its country of origin. This breed resulted from the crossbreeding of several foreign dog breeds with local hunting dogs. The Estonian Hound's development was announced by an ultimatum issued by the Soviet Union\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture and Economy in 1947, which ordered every Soviet Republic to establish a local breed of hunting dogs to replace the large breeds of hunting dogs bred at that moment. These large dogs were blamed for the rapid decline of Estonia's wildlife population; it was established that only dogs with a maximum height of 17 inches were allowed to hunt. The result was a very agile and hard driven breed that has enjoyed tremendous popularity since then: the modern Estonian Hound. After Estonia regained its independence, the Estonian Hound was proclaimed the country's national dog.,The Estonian Hound is a dog of medium size and a strong muscular body, bone structure and muscles that are well developed. It has no folds in its skin and drop ears. The coat is short and rough and should be shiny. The undercoat is weakly developed. This breed's eyes are dark brown colored.

It is good with other dogs and usually also with cats if used to them as a puppy. They love human attention and can get upset when left alone. Proper human to canine communication is really important to its training.

Some of the breeding methods of those early developers were criticised; one of the first breeders of the Field Spaniel, Thomas Jacobs, said of the origin; \"Much has been written and said on the purity of the breed; deprecating the means I have adopted to produce them as calculated to alter a presumed type, and frequent missiles have been hurled at me and my dogs from behind the hedge.

Like most sporting dogs, they are the result of different crosses.\"They were unpopular with sportsmen as the dark colours of the breed did not show up in hunting conditions, and the elongated and short shape of the early breed was not very practical for moving easily through cover. The low-slung variety of Field Spaniel were developed by Phineas Bullock from dogs previously owned by Sir Francis Burdett, the secretary of the Birmingham Dog Show. Burdett was said to have owned a variety of black Cocker Spaniels. Bullock crossed the Field Spaniel with the Sussex Spaniel and the English Water Spaniel. In the 1870s he was very successful in the show ring with his variety of Field Spaniel; however, it resulted in a dog that was almost exactly like a Sussex Spaniel with the exception of the head itself.The dog who is considered to be the father of the modern English Cocker Spaniel is Ch. Obo, who was born in 1879 to a Sussex Spaniel father and a Field Spaniel mother. Obo's son Ch. Obo II is considered to be the father of the modern American Cocker Spaniel, who was described as being only ten inches high with quite a long body.By 1909, the average weight of a Field Spaniel was 35\u201345 pounds (16\u201320 kg). Further mixing of the breed occurred with elements of the Basset Hound introduced. Various genetic health issues arose and action was taken in order to correct the problems within the breed. English Springer Spaniels were used to introduce healthier elements into the breed and resulted in the longer legged spaniel that we know today. Most of the modern breed can be traced to four dogs from the 1950s; Colombina of Teffont, Elmbury Morwena of Rhiwlas, Gormac Teal, and Ronayne Regal.The Field Spaniel remains a rare breed, even in the UK. In 2009, a total of 51 dogs were registered with The Kennel Club and has been in steady decline since 2000. Out of all the Spaniel breeds registered with The Kennel Club, the Field Spaniel has the lowest numbered registered year on year, with only the Sussex Spaniel coming a close second with 60 registrations in 2009. This is compared to the English Springer Spaniel with 12,700 and the English Cocker Spaniel with 22,211 registrations in 2009 alone. In order to promote the breed, they have been registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by The Kennel Club.,The standard size for a Field Spaniel is 16\u201319 inches (41\u201348 cm) tall at the withers, and a weight of between 35\u201360 pounds (16\u201327 kg). This places it roughly between the English Cocker Spaniel and the English Springer Spaniel in size. Its coat comes in solid colours of black and liver, or in roan. Tan points, white markings on the throat and the chest can be ticked or the same colour as the rest of the body.They have a moderately long single coat with no undercoat. Feathering of the fur appears on the chest, belly, ears and on the back of the legs. The coat is not as heavy as that of a Cocker Spaniel but requires grooming in order to prevent mats from appearing in the fur. Docking of tails has been banned in a number of countries, including the UK, however, an exemption is made for working animals." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c47d" }, "breed": "Galgo Espa\u00f1ol", "origin": "Spain", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galgo_Espa%C3%B1ol", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Galgo-Espanol.jpg/220px-Galgo-Espanol.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5eab" }, "breed": "Galgo Espa\u00f1ol", "contenido": "The French Spaniel (Epagneul Fran\u00e7ais) is a breed of dog of the Spaniel-like setter. It was developed in France and Canada as a hunting dog, descended from dogs of the 14th century. Popular with royalty during the Middle Ages, it nearly became extinct by the turn of the 20th century but was saved by the efforts of Father Fournier, a French priest. One of the largest breeds of Spaniel, it typically has a white coat with brown markings. It is a friendly breed that has few health issues, but can be affected by a syndrome called acral mutilation and analgesia. The breed is recognised by Canadian and international kennel clubs but not by The Kennel Club (UK). The American Kennel Club has included the breed in its Foundation Stock Service, the first step to full recognition.,Spaniels were first mentioned in France during the 14th century in Gaston III of Foix-B\u00e9arn's work Livre de chasse, later translated into English as The Master of Game. The French Spaniel was referred to as a specific type of Spaniel by 1660 and was noted as being distinctive from the King Charles Spaniel of the Holland type.The breed was popular during the Middle Ages with it used for falconry and as a settling dog for net hunting. They became a favourite of French Royalty and Kings and Princes at the royal courts of Versailles favored them over other breeds of hunting dogs. In addition, Catherine I of Russia (1684\u20131727) was known to have owned a French Spaniel named Babe. During this period, the French Spaniel was known to have split into several regional types.The Sporting Magazine wrote of the French Spaniel and the hunting of mallards in 1805, \"The rough French Spaniel has been found the best companion on these occasions: he watches the conduct of the sportsman, and, with a velocity unequalled, darts on the wounded prey, presents it with all possible speed at the feet of his master.\" In the 1850s, the Brittany (formerly known as Brittany Spaniel) was developed from crossing French Spaniels with English Setters.James de Connick established the first breed standard for the French Spaniel in 1891. At the turn of the 20th century, the numbers of French Spaniels dropped so low that they nearly became extinct due to competition from foreign sporting dogs, in particular as French hunters chose to hunt particularly with English breeds of hunting dogs. A French priest named Father Fournier undertook the task of gathering the remaining French Spaniels in his Saint Hillaire kennels in order to preserve the breed. There he built the lineages that are representatives of those we now have. The French Spaniel Club was founded in 1921, with Father Fournier as the president of the association. The modern French Spaniel is one of a group of recognised French Spaniels, including the Brittany, Picardy and Blue Picardy.,The French Spaniel was little known outside France and neighboring countries until it was introduced in the Canadian province of Quebec in the 1970s. It quickly became a popular dog for hunting woodcock and grouse. The Club de l'\u00c9pagneul Fran\u00e7ais du Canada was formed in 1978 to ensure the French Spaniel would continue to meet breed standards and to pursue official recognition by the Canadian Kennel Club, by which the breed was recognised in 1985.French Spaniels are also recognized by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, and the United Kennel Club. The Kennel Club (UK) and the American Kennel Club do not recognize the French Spaniel, but is recognised by the North American Versatile Hunting Dog Association, and can be registered with US dog registries in order to record their registries and compete in associated dog shows, such as the Dog Registry of America, American Canine Association, and America's Pet Registry.To qualify for recognition by the American Kennel Club, a national breed club must first be established and a written request needs to be sent to the AKC along with a breed standard. This enables qualification for the Foundation Stock Service. The next step is to qualify to compete in the Miscellaneous Class. This requires a minimum of one hundred active members in the national breed club, along with a minimum of three to four hundred dogs in the United States with a three generation pedigree (all dogs in those pedigrees must be of the same breed). In addition, they must be geographically spread across twenty states or more, and finally the clubs by-laws and constitution must be reviewed as well as breed observations made by AKC staff. There is a typical stay of between one and three years in the Miscellaneous Class before full recognition is granted. During this time, the breed club must be seen to be active and hold seminars, matches as well as local and national speciality shows. The Kennel Club (UK) does not have a miscellaneous class or foundation stock service, instead it requires British bred dog and three generation pedigrees of them, along with details from the country of origin including the breed standard. This allows listing on the Imported Breeds Register, with full recognition granted at the discretion of the Kennel Club Review Committee." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c481" }, "breed": "German Hound", "origin": "Germany", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Hound", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/German_Hound_from_1915.JPG/220px-German_Hound_from_1915.JPG", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5eaf" }, "breed": "German Hound", "contenido": "The German Hound (Deutsche Bracke) is a breed of dog originating in Westphalia, a region of Germany. The German Hound is of the scenthound type, used for hunting both large and small game.,The German Hound  is a small hound, 40 \u2013 53 cm (16 - 21 ins) at the withers, with long, drooped ears and a long, narrow tail. It is distinguished by a long, somewhat narrow head, and a rectangular body, described as \"elegant\".The coat has hard, almost bristly, short fur, usually tricolor (red to yellow with a black mantle), with white markings called Bracken marks - a white muzzle, chest, legs, collar, and tip of the tail, and a blaze on the head.,In 1896, the Deutschen Bracken Club, encompassing all of the local types of Bracke in northwest Germany, was formed in Olpe. The breeds were merged in 1900 as one breed and were officially designated Deutsche Bracke. This breed was formerly called by a variety of old regional names such as \"Olpe Bracke\", \"Sauerl\u00e4nder Bracke\" and \"Westphalian Bracke\", and other local types now blended into one breed. The only breeds of Bracke in the area today are the German Hound and the Westphalian Dachsbracke. The Westphalian Dachsbracke is a short-legged dog, possibly a cross of a Bracke with the Dachshund.Hunting with the Bracke in early times was done with hunters on horses following the hounds, as developed by the ancient Celts chasing deer, and modern-day fox hunters. Another sport, developed in the 16th century,  did not require the expense of horses and big kennels, and made use of firearms, called Brackade. Hounds hunting this way tenaciously follow the game while voicing cries that communicate to the hunter as to where the dog is and what type of game the dog is following. Today, the Deutsche Bracke is usually used to hunt deer, but also rabbits and fox. Often, it is hunted singly as a leash hound, to hunt on smaller areas. The space needed to hunt a pack of hounds is described by the breed club as a minimum area of 1,000 ha (2471 acres). Related to the hunting with Bracke is the use of horns to communicate with the dogs, a custom that is continued today.,The German Hound was recognized by the Verband f\u00fcr das Deutsche Hundewesen (German Kennel Club) through the Deutschen Bracken Club was formed in 1896 and continues today, and oversees breeding and hunt testing, as well as preserving traditions of Bracke hunting. The German Hound was the first Bracke to be registered as a distinct breed, in 1900. and by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale as breed number 299 in Group 6 (Scenthounds), Section 1.3 (Small hounds). Of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world, only the United Kennel Club in the US recognises the German Hound, in its Scenthound Group. The German Hound also may be recognised by any of the many minor registries, rare breed groups, hunting clubs, and internet registry businesses under its original name, discarded antique names, translations of the name, or variations on the name. The German Hound is strictly a hunting dog, and seldom seen outside its native country. Outside the home country, purchasers of dogs represented as German Hound should research the dog's background, especially if it is registered with one of the minor clubs that require little to no documentation before accepting a dog or litter for registration." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c482" }, "breed": "German Longhaired Pointer", "origin": "Germany", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Longhaired_Pointer", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/DeutschLanghaarneu.jpg/220px-DeutschLanghaarneu.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c694" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/german_longhaired_pointer.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 4, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 1, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 4, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 5, "energy": 4, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 14, "max_height_male": 28, "max_height_female": 28, "max_weight_male": 80, "max_weight_female": 80, "min_height_male": 22, "min_height_female": 22, "min_weight_male": 55, "min_weight_female": 55, "breed": "German Longhaired Pointer" }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6d7" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/german_longhaired_pointer.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 4, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 1, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 4, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 5, "energy": 4, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 14, "max_height_male": 28, "max_height_female": 28, "max_weight_male": 80, "max_weight_female": 80, "min_height_male": 22, "min_height_female": 22, "min_weight_male": 55, "min_weight_female": 55, "breed": "German Longhaired Pointer" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5eb0" }, "breed": "German Longhaired Pointer", "contenido": "The German Longhaired Pointer (GLP) is a breed of dog.

The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.,It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion dog, and according to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations in 2013.,During the 1890s, attempts were being made to standardise dog breeds. Dogs were being bred to preserve traits that assisted in their job of herding sheep and protecting their flocks from predators. In Germany this was practised within local communities, where shepherds selected and bred dogs. It was recognised that the breed had the necessary skills for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen senses of smell. The results were dogs that were able to do such things, but that differed significantly, both in appearance and ability, from one locality to another.To combat these differences, the Phylax Society was formed in 1891 with the intention of creating standardised development plans for native dog breeds in Germany. The society disbanded after only three years due to ongoing internal conflicts regarding the traits in dogs that the society should promote; some members believed dogs should be bred solely for working purposes, while others believed dogs should be bred also for appearance. While unsuccessful in their goal, the Phylax Society had inspired people to pursue standardising dog breeds independently.,With the rise of large, industrialised cities in Germany, the predator population began to decline, rendering sheepdogs unnecessary. At the same time, the awareness of sheepdogs as a versatile, intelligent class of canine began to rise. Max von Stephanitz, an ex-cavalry captain and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was an ex-member of the Phylax Society who firmly believed dogs should be bred for working. He admired the intelligence, strength and ability of Germany's native sheepdogs, but could not find any one single breed that satisfied him as the perfect working dog.In 1899, von Stephanitz was attending a dog show when he was shown a dog named Hektor Linksrhein. Hektor was the product of few generations of selective breeding and completely fulfilled what von Stephanitz believed a working dog should be. He was pleased with the strength of the dog and was so taken by the animal's intelligence, loyalty, and beauty, that he purchased him immediately. After purchasing the dog he changed his name to Horand von Grafrath and von Stephanitz founded the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde (Society for German Shepherd Dogs). Horand was declared to be the first German Shepherd Dog, and was the first dog added to the society's breed register. In just a few decades of the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde's establishment, the breed became one of the world's most popular and numerous, a position it has maintained to this day. By 1923, the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde claimed 50,000 dues-paying members in more than 500 branches in Germany alone.Horand became the center-point of the breeding programs and was bred with dogs belonging to other society members that displayed desirable traits and with dogs from Thuringia, Franconia, and W\u00fcrttemberg. Fathering many pups, Horand's most prolific was Hektor von Schwaben. Hektor was inbred with another of Horand's offspring and produced Heinz von Starkenburg, Beowulf, and Pilot, who later sired a total of 84 pups, mostly through being inbred with Hektor's other offspring. This inbreeding was deemed necessary in order to fix the traits being sought in the breed. Beowulf's progeny also were inbred and it is from these pups that all German shepherds draw a genetic link. It is believed the society accomplished its goal mostly due to von Stephanitz's strong, uncompromising leadership and he is therefore credited with being the creator of the German Shepherd Dog.During the first half of the twentieth century, the breed came to be strongly identified with Imperial and Nazi Germany, because of its association with purity and militarism. German shepherds were coveted as \"germanische Urhunde\", being close to the wolf, and became very fashionable during the Nazi era. Adolf Hitler acquired a German Shepherd named \"Prinz\" in 1921, during his years of poverty, but he had been forced to lodge the dog elsewhere. However, she managed to escape and return to him. Hitler, who adored the loyalty and obedience of the dog, thereafter developed a great liking for the breed. Hitler kept several more of the breed, including Blondi, who was among several dogs in the 'F\u00fchrerbunker' during the Battle of Berlin at the end of the Second World War. Dogs played a role in Nazi propaganda by portraying Hitler as an animal lover. Preparing for his suicide, Hitler ordered Dr. Werner Haase to test a cyanide capsule on Blondi, and the dog died as a result. Erna Flegel, a nurse who worked at the emergency casualty station in the Reich Chancellery stated in 2005 that Blondi's death had affected the people in the bunker more than Eva Braun's suicide. German Shepherds were also used widely as guard dogs at Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust.When the German Shepherd was introduced to the United States it was initially a popular dog. But as the dogs' popularity grew, it became associated as a dangerous breed owned by gangsters and bootleggers. The reputation of the German shepherds as a dangerous breed had grown to such an extent that it was briefly banned to import them in Australia in 1929. Potential legislation was even considered to require that all German shepherds in South Australia be sterilised.,The breed was named Deutscher Sch\u00e4ferhund, by von Stephanitz, literally translating to \"German Shepherd Dog\".  At the time, all other herding dogs in Germany were referred to by this name; they thus became known as Altdeutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde, or Old German herding dogs.,The direct translation of the name was adopted for use in the stud-book; however, at the end of the First World War, it was believed that the inclusion of the word \"German\" would harm the breed's popularity, due to the anti-German sentiment of the era. The breed was officially renamed by the UK Kennel Club to \"Alsatian Wolf Dog\", after the French region of Alsace bordering Germany.Eventually, the appendage \"wolf dog\" was dropped, after numerous campaigns by breeders who were worried that becoming known as a wolf-dog hybrid would affect the breed's popularity and legality. The name Alsatian remained for five decades, until 1977, when successful campaigns by dog enthusiasts pressured the British kennel clubs to allow the breed to be registered again as German Shepherds. The word \"Alsatian\" once appeared in parentheses as part of the formal breed name of the American Kennel Club and was removed in 2010.,The German Shepherd Dog, also known as the Alsatian, is a German breed of working dog of medium to large size.

The word \"Alsatian\" once appeared in parentheses as part of the formal breed name of the American Kennel Club and was removed in 2010.,The German Shepherd Dog, also known as the Alsatian, is a German breed of working dog of medium to large size. The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.,It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion dog, and according to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations in 2013.,During the 1890s, attempts were being made to standardise dog breeds. Dogs were being bred to preserve traits that assisted in their job of herding sheep and protecting their flocks from predators. In Germany this was practised within local communities, where shepherds selected and bred dogs. It was recognised that the breed had the necessary skills for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen senses of smell. The results were dogs that were able to do such things, but that differed significantly, both in appearance and ability, from one locality to another.To combat these differences, the Phylax Society was formed in 1891 with the intention of creating standardised development plans for native dog breeds in Germany. The society disbanded after only three years due to ongoing internal conflicts regarding the traits in dogs that the society should promote; some members believed dogs should be bred solely for working purposes, while others believed dogs should be bred also for appearance. While unsuccessful in their goal, the Phylax Society had inspired people to pursue standardising dog breeds independently.,With the rise of large, industrialised cities in Germany, the predator population began to decline, rendering sheepdogs unnecessary. At the same time, the awareness of sheepdogs as a versatile, intelligent class of canine began to rise. Max von Stephanitz, an ex-cavalry captain and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was an ex-member of the Phylax Society who firmly believed dogs should be bred for working. He admired the intelligence, strength and ability of Germany's native sheepdogs, but could not find any one single breed that satisfied him as the perfect working dog.In 1899, von Stephanitz was attending a dog show when he was shown a dog named Hektor Linksrhein. Hektor was the product of few generations of selective breeding and completely fulfilled what von Stephanitz believed a working dog should be. He was pleased with the strength of the dog and was so taken by the animal's intelligence, loyalty, and beauty, that he purchased him immediately. After purchasing the dog he changed his name to Horand von Grafrath and von Stephanitz founded the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde (Society for German Shepherd Dogs). Horand was declared to be the first German Shepherd Dog, and was the first dog added to the society's breed register. In just a few decades of the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde's establishment, the breed became one of the world's most popular and numerous, a position it has maintained to this day. By 1923, the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde claimed 50,000 dues-paying members in more than 500 branches in Germany alone.Horand became the center-point of the breeding programs and was bred with dogs belonging to other society members that displayed desirable traits and with dogs from Thuringia, Franconia, and W\u00fcrttemberg. Fathering many pups, Horand's most prolific was Hektor von Schwaben. Hektor was inbred with another of Horand's offspring and produced Heinz von Starkenburg, Beowulf, and Pilot, who later sired a total of 84 pups, mostly through being inbred with Hektor's other offspring. This inbreeding was deemed necessary in order to fix the traits being sought in the breed. Beowulf's progeny also were inbred and it is from these pups that all German shepherds draw a genetic link. It is believed the society accomplished its goal mostly due to von Stephanitz's strong, uncompromising leadership and he is therefore credited with being the creator of the German Shepherd Dog.During the first half of the twentieth century, the breed came to be strongly identified with Imperial and Nazi Germany, because of its association with purity and militarism. German shepherds were coveted as \"germanische Urhunde\", being close to the wolf, and became very fashionable during the Nazi era. Adolf Hitler acquired a German Shepherd named \"Prinz\" in 1921, during his years of poverty, but he had been forced to lodge the dog elsewhere. However, she managed to escape and return to him. Hitler, who adored the loyalty and obedience of the dog, thereafter developed a great liking for the breed. Hitler kept several more of the breed, including Blondi, who was among several dogs in the 'F\u00fchrerbunker' during the Battle of Berlin at the end of the Second World War. Dogs played a role in Nazi propaganda by portraying Hitler as an animal lover. Preparing for his suicide, Hitler ordered Dr. Werner Haase to test a cyanide capsule on Blondi, and the dog died as a result. Erna Flegel, a nurse who worked at the emergency casualty station in the Reich Chancellery stated in 2005 that Blondi's death had affected the people in the bunker more than Eva Braun's suicide. German Shepherds were also used widely as guard dogs at Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust.When the German Shepherd was introduced to the United States it was initially a popular dog. But as the dogs' popularity grew, it became associated as a dangerous breed owned by gangsters and bootleggers. The reputation of the German shepherds as a dangerous breed had grown to such an extent that it was briefly banned to import them in Australia in 1929. Potential legislation was even considered to require that all German shepherds in South Australia be sterilised.,The breed was named Deutscher Sch\u00e4ferhund, by von Stephanitz, literally translating to \"German Shepherd Dog\".  At the time, all other herding dogs in Germany were referred to by this name; they thus became known as Altdeutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde, or Old German herding dogs.,The direct translation of the name was adopted for use in the stud-book; however, at the end of the First World War, it was believed that the inclusion of the word \"German\" would harm the breed's popularity, due to the anti-German sentiment of the era.

The breed was officially renamed by the UK Kennel Club to \"Alsatian Wolf Dog\", after the French region of Alsace bordering Germany.Eventually, the appendage \"wolf dog\" was dropped, after numerous campaigns by breeders who were worried that becoming known as a wolf-dog hybrid would affect the breed's popularity and legality. The name Alsatian remained for five decades, until 1977, when successful campaigns by dog enthusiasts pressured the British kennel clubs to allow the breed to be registered again as German Shepherds. The word \"Alsatian\" once appeared in parentheses as part of the formal breed name of the American Kennel Club and was removed in 2010.,The German Shepherd Dog, also known as the Alsatian, is a German breed of working dog of medium to large size. The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.,It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion dog, and according to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations in 2013.,During the 1890s, attempts were being made to standardise dog breeds. Dogs were being bred to preserve traits that assisted in their job of herding sheep and protecting their flocks from predators. In Germany this was practised within local communities, where shepherds selected and bred dogs. It was recognised that the breed had the necessary skills for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen senses of smell. The results were dogs that were able to do such things, but that differed significantly, both in appearance and ability, from one locality to another.To combat these differences, the Phylax Society was formed in 1891 with the intention of creating standardised development plans for native dog breeds in Germany. The society disbanded after only three years due to ongoing internal conflicts regarding the traits in dogs that the society should promote; some members believed dogs should be bred solely for working purposes, while others believed dogs should be bred also for appearance. While unsuccessful in their goal, the Phylax Society had inspired people to pursue standardising dog breeds independently.,With the rise of large, industrialised cities in Germany, the predator population began to decline, rendering sheepdogs unnecessary. At the same time, the awareness of sheepdogs as a versatile, intelligent class of canine began to rise. Max von Stephanitz, an ex-cavalry captain and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was an ex-member of the Phylax Society who firmly believed dogs should be bred for working. He admired the intelligence, strength and ability of Germany's native sheepdogs, but could not find any one single breed that satisfied him as the perfect working dog.In 1899, von Stephanitz was attending a dog show when he was shown a dog named Hektor Linksrhein. Hektor was the product of few generations of selective breeding and completely fulfilled what von Stephanitz believed a working dog should be. He was pleased with the strength of the dog and was so taken by the animal's intelligence, loyalty, and beauty, that he purchased him immediately. After purchasing the dog he changed his name to Horand von Grafrath and von Stephanitz founded the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde (Society for German Shepherd Dogs). Horand was declared to be the first German Shepherd Dog, and was the first dog added to the society's breed register. In just a few decades of the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde's establishment, the breed became one of the world's most popular and numerous, a position it has maintained to this day. By 1923, the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde claimed 50,000 dues-paying members in more than 500 branches in Germany alone.Horand became the center-point of the breeding programs and was bred with dogs belonging to other society members that displayed desirable traits and with dogs from Thuringia, Franconia, and W\u00fcrttemberg. Fathering many pups, Horand's most prolific was Hektor von Schwaben. Hektor was inbred with another of Horand's offspring and produced Heinz von Starkenburg, Beowulf, and Pilot, who later sired a total of 84 pups, mostly through being inbred with Hektor's other offspring. This inbreeding was deemed necessary in order to fix the traits being sought in the breed. Beowulf's progeny also were inbred and it is from these pups that all German shepherds draw a genetic link. It is believed the society accomplished its goal mostly due to von Stephanitz's strong, uncompromising leadership and he is therefore credited with being the creator of the German Shepherd Dog.During the first half of the twentieth century, the breed came to be strongly identified with Imperial and Nazi Germany, because of its association with purity and militarism. German shepherds were coveted as \"germanische Urhunde\", being close to the wolf, and became very fashionable during the Nazi era. Adolf Hitler acquired a German Shepherd named \"Prinz\" in 1921, during his years of poverty, but he had been forced to lodge the dog elsewhere. However, she managed to escape and return to him. Hitler, who adored the loyalty and obedience of the dog, thereafter developed a great liking for the breed. Hitler kept several more of the breed, including Blondi, who was among several dogs in the 'F\u00fchrerbunker' during the Battle of Berlin at the end of the Second World War. Dogs played a role in Nazi propaganda by portraying Hitler as an animal lover. Preparing for his suicide, Hitler ordered Dr. Werner Haase to test a cyanide capsule on Blondi, and the dog died as a result. Erna Flegel, a nurse who worked at the emergency casualty station in the Reich Chancellery stated in 2005 that Blondi's death had affected the people in the bunker more than Eva Braun's suicide. German Shepherds were also used widely as guard dogs at Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust.When the German Shepherd was introduced to the United States it was initially a popular dog. But as the dogs' popularity grew, it became associated as a dangerous breed owned by gangsters and bootleggers. The reputation of the German shepherds as a dangerous breed had grown to such an extent that it was briefly banned to import them in Australia in 1929. Potential legislation was even considered to require that all German shepherds in South Australia be sterilised.,The breed was named Deutscher Sch\u00e4ferhund, by von Stephanitz, literally translating to \"German Shepherd Dog\".

Potential legislation was even considered to require that all German shepherds in South Australia be sterilised.,The breed was named Deutscher Sch\u00e4ferhund, by von Stephanitz, literally translating to \"German Shepherd Dog\".  At the time, all other herding dogs in Germany were referred to by this name; they thus became known as Altdeutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde, or Old German herding dogs.,The direct translation of the name was adopted for use in the stud-book; however, at the end of the First World War, it was believed that the inclusion of the word \"German\" would harm the breed's popularity, due to the anti-German sentiment of the era. The breed was officially renamed by the UK Kennel Club to \"Alsatian Wolf Dog\", after the French region of Alsace bordering Germany.Eventually, the appendage \"wolf dog\" was dropped, after numerous campaigns by breeders who were worried that becoming known as a wolf-dog hybrid would affect the breed's popularity and legality. The name Alsatian remained for five decades, until 1977, when successful campaigns by dog enthusiasts pressured the British kennel clubs to allow the breed to be registered again as German Shepherds. The word \"Alsatian\" once appeared in parentheses as part of the formal breed name of the American Kennel Club and was removed in 2010.,The German Shepherd Dog, also known as the Alsatian, is a German breed of working dog of medium to large size. The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.,It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion dog, and according to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations in 2013.,During the 1890s, attempts were being made to standardise dog breeds. Dogs were being bred to preserve traits that assisted in their job of herding sheep and protecting their flocks from predators. In Germany this was practised within local communities, where shepherds selected and bred dogs. It was recognised that the breed had the necessary skills for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen senses of smell. The results were dogs that were able to do such things, but that differed significantly, both in appearance and ability, from one locality to another.To combat these differences, the Phylax Society was formed in 1891 with the intention of creating standardised development plans for native dog breeds in Germany. The society disbanded after only three years due to ongoing internal conflicts regarding the traits in dogs that the society should promote; some members believed dogs should be bred solely for working purposes, while others believed dogs should be bred also for appearance. While unsuccessful in their goal, the Phylax Society had inspired people to pursue standardising dog breeds independently.,With the rise of large, industrialised cities in Germany, the predator population began to decline, rendering sheepdogs unnecessary. At the same time, the awareness of sheepdogs as a versatile, intelligent class of canine began to rise. Max von Stephanitz, an ex-cavalry captain and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was an ex-member of the Phylax Society who firmly believed dogs should be bred for working. He admired the intelligence, strength and ability of Germany's native sheepdogs, but could not find any one single breed that satisfied him as the perfect working dog.In 1899, von Stephanitz was attending a dog show when he was shown a dog named Hektor Linksrhein. Hektor was the product of few generations of selective breeding and completely fulfilled what von Stephanitz believed a working dog should be. He was pleased with the strength of the dog and was so taken by the animal's intelligence, loyalty, and beauty, that he purchased him immediately. After purchasing the dog he changed his name to Horand von Grafrath and von Stephanitz founded the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde (Society for German Shepherd Dogs). Horand was declared to be the first German Shepherd Dog, and was the first dog added to the society's breed register. In just a few decades of the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde's establishment, the breed became one of the world's most popular and numerous, a position it has maintained to this day. By 1923, the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde claimed 50,000 dues-paying members in more than 500 branches in Germany alone.Horand became the center-point of the breeding programs and was bred with dogs belonging to other society members that displayed desirable traits and with dogs from Thuringia, Franconia, and W\u00fcrttemberg. Fathering many pups, Horand's most prolific was Hektor von Schwaben. Hektor was inbred with another of Horand's offspring and produced Heinz von Starkenburg, Beowulf, and Pilot, who later sired a total of 84 pups, mostly through being inbred with Hektor's other offspring. This inbreeding was deemed necessary in order to fix the traits being sought in the breed. Beowulf's progeny also were inbred and it is from these pups that all German shepherds draw a genetic link. It is believed the society accomplished its goal mostly due to von Stephanitz's strong, uncompromising leadership and he is therefore credited with being the creator of the German Shepherd Dog.During the first half of the twentieth century, the breed came to be strongly identified with Imperial and Nazi Germany, because of its association with purity and militarism. German shepherds were coveted as \"germanische Urhunde\", being close to the wolf, and became very fashionable during the Nazi era. Adolf Hitler acquired a German Shepherd named \"Prinz\" in 1921, during his years of poverty, but he had been forced to lodge the dog elsewhere. However, she managed to escape and return to him. Hitler, who adored the loyalty and obedience of the dog, thereafter developed a great liking for the breed. Hitler kept several more of the breed, including Blondi, who was among several dogs in the 'F\u00fchrerbunker' during the Battle of Berlin at the end of the Second World War. Dogs played a role in Nazi propaganda by portraying Hitler as an animal lover. Preparing for his suicide, Hitler ordered Dr. Werner Haase to test a cyanide capsule on Blondi, and the dog died as a result. Erna Flegel, a nurse who worked at the emergency casualty station in the Reich Chancellery stated in 2005 that Blondi's death had affected the people in the bunker more than Eva Braun's suicide. German Shepherds were also used widely as guard dogs at Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust.When the German Shepherd was introduced to the United States it was initially a popular dog.

The reputation of the German shepherds as a dangerous breed had grown to such an extent that it was briefly banned to import them in Australia in 1929. Potential legislation was even considered to require that all German shepherds in South Australia be sterilised.,The breed was named Deutscher Sch\u00e4ferhund, by von Stephanitz, literally translating to \"German Shepherd Dog\".  At the time, all other herding dogs in Germany were referred to by this name; they thus became known as Altdeutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde, or Old German herding dogs.,The direct translation of the name was adopted for use in the stud-book; however, at the end of the First World War, it was believed that the inclusion of the word \"German\" would harm the breed's popularity, due to the anti-German sentiment of the era. The breed was officially renamed by the UK Kennel Club to \"Alsatian Wolf Dog\", after the French region of Alsace bordering Germany.Eventually, the appendage \"wolf dog\" was dropped, after numerous campaigns by breeders who were worried that becoming known as a wolf-dog hybrid would affect the breed's popularity and legality. The name Alsatian remained for five decades, until 1977, when successful campaigns by dog enthusiasts pressured the British kennel clubs to allow the breed to be registered again as German Shepherds. The word \"Alsatian\" once appeared in parentheses as part of the formal breed name of the American Kennel Club and was removed in 2010.,The German Shepherd Dog, also known as the Alsatian, is a German breed of working dog of medium to large size. The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.,It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion dog, and according to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations in 2013.,During the 1890s, attempts were being made to standardise dog breeds. Dogs were being bred to preserve traits that assisted in their job of herding sheep and protecting their flocks from predators. In Germany this was practised within local communities, where shepherds selected and bred dogs. It was recognised that the breed had the necessary skills for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen senses of smell. The results were dogs that were able to do such things, but that differed significantly, both in appearance and ability, from one locality to another.To combat these differences, the Phylax Society was formed in 1891 with the intention of creating standardised development plans for native dog breeds in Germany. The society disbanded after only three years due to ongoing internal conflicts regarding the traits in dogs that the society should promote; some members believed dogs should be bred solely for working purposes, while others believed dogs should be bred also for appearance. While unsuccessful in their goal, the Phylax Society had inspired people to pursue standardising dog breeds independently.,With the rise of large, industrialised cities in Germany, the predator population began to decline, rendering sheepdogs unnecessary. At the same time, the awareness of sheepdogs as a versatile, intelligent class of canine began to rise. Max von Stephanitz, an ex-cavalry captain and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was an ex-member of the Phylax Society who firmly believed dogs should be bred for working. He admired the intelligence, strength and ability of Germany's native sheepdogs, but could not find any one single breed that satisfied him as the perfect working dog.In 1899, von Stephanitz was attending a dog show when he was shown a dog named Hektor Linksrhein. Hektor was the product of few generations of selective breeding and completely fulfilled what von Stephanitz believed a working dog should be. He was pleased with the strength of the dog and was so taken by the animal's intelligence, loyalty, and beauty, that he purchased him immediately. After purchasing the dog he changed his name to Horand von Grafrath and von Stephanitz founded the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde (Society for German Shepherd Dogs). Horand was declared to be the first German Shepherd Dog, and was the first dog added to the society's breed register. In just a few decades of the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde's establishment, the breed became one of the world's most popular and numerous, a position it has maintained to this day. By 1923, the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde claimed 50,000 dues-paying members in more than 500 branches in Germany alone.Horand became the center-point of the breeding programs and was bred with dogs belonging to other society members that displayed desirable traits and with dogs from Thuringia, Franconia, and W\u00fcrttemberg. Fathering many pups, Horand's most prolific was Hektor von Schwaben. Hektor was inbred with another of Horand's offspring and produced Heinz von Starkenburg, Beowulf, and Pilot, who later sired a total of 84 pups, mostly through being inbred with Hektor's other offspring. This inbreeding was deemed necessary in order to fix the traits being sought in the breed. Beowulf's progeny also were inbred and it is from these pups that all German shepherds draw a genetic link. It is believed the society accomplished its goal mostly due to von Stephanitz's strong, uncompromising leadership and he is therefore credited with being the creator of the German Shepherd Dog.During the first half of the twentieth century, the breed came to be strongly identified with Imperial and Nazi Germany, because of its association with purity and militarism. German shepherds were coveted as \"germanische Urhunde\", being close to the wolf, and became very fashionable during the Nazi era. Adolf Hitler acquired a German Shepherd named \"Prinz\" in 1921, during his years of poverty, but he had been forced to lodge the dog elsewhere. However, she managed to escape and return to him. Hitler, who adored the loyalty and obedience of the dog, thereafter developed a great liking for the breed. Hitler kept several more of the breed, including Blondi, who was among several dogs in the 'F\u00fchrerbunker' during the Battle of Berlin at the end of the Second World War. Dogs played a role in Nazi propaganda by portraying Hitler as an animal lover. Preparing for his suicide, Hitler ordered Dr. Werner Haase to test a cyanide capsule on Blondi, and the dog died as a result. Erna Flegel, a nurse who worked at the emergency casualty station in the Reich Chancellery stated in 2005 that Blondi's death had affected the people in the bunker more than Eva Braun's suicide. German Shepherds were also used widely as guard dogs at Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust.When the German Shepherd was introduced to the United States it was initially a popular dog. But as the dogs' popularity grew, it became associated as a dangerous breed owned by gangsters and bootleggers. The reputation of the German shepherds as a dangerous breed had grown to such an extent that it was briefly banned to import them in Australia in 1929.

They are the heaviest of the setter breeds, with males reaching 27 inches (69 cm) at the withers and up to 80 pounds (36 kg) in weight.,The AKC describes the Gordon Setter temperament as \"alert, interested, and confident. He is fearless and willing, intelligent, and capable. He is loyal and affectionate, and strong-minded enough to stand the rigors of training\". Gordons are intensely loyal to their owners; thrive in an attentive, loving environment; and are good family dogs. Puppies and adult dogs can be quite boisterous, and although they are patient by nature, may not be suitable for households with very young children. Gordons are sensitive and empathic, eager to learn, and need firm but gentle handling. Early socialisation and obedience training is important. The breed is one of the slowest to mature, not hitting prime until three years of age or more, and will show puppy-like characteristics well into their older years.,Gordons were bred to run, and require 60 to 80 minutes of vigorous exercise daily. Young dogs should not be over-exercised or begin agility training until they are at least 18 months old, to avoid joint problems later in life. Because of their hunting instincts, Gordons should not be allowed to roam freely if unsupervised, as they are apt to wander into a potentially dangerous traffic situation while following a scent." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c495" }, "breed": "Griffon Bleu de Gascogne", "origin": "France", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffon_Bleu_de_Gascogne", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/04031124_Griffon_Bleu_de_Gascogne.jpg/220px-04031124_Griffon_Bleu_de_Gascogne.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ecb" }, "breed": "Griffon Bleu de Gascogne", "contenido": "The Griffon Bleu de Gascogne is a breed of dog of the scenthound type, originating in France, and is a versatile hunting dog, used on small and large game, in packs or individually.

As with all setters, it is classified as a gundog in the UK and is included in the sporting group in America and Canada. It is virtually identical in use and temperament to the related Irish Setter, as well as the Gordon and English setters, but is more often found as a working gun dog.,The original purpose of the breed was to hunt gamebirds. In the UK, their quarry can be partridge or grouse, pheasant, ptarmigan, blackgame, snipe or woodcock as all these birds try to avoid predators by hiding rather than flying away. Overseas, they may be used to hunt quail, willow grouse, sand grouse, guinea fowl, sagehen or francolin.,Despite the breed's early origins, it had almost become extinct at the end of the 19th century. During the 1920s, dedicated breeders managed to revive interest and restore the Irish Red and White setter to a viable position. It is still considered a vulnerable breed, but has gained recognition from all major kennel clubs.,The function of setters is to find and locate game by quartering ground as it searches for the scent carried in the wind by birds such as grouse, partridge, pheasant or snipe. It is fast and wide-ranging. As it gallops in its quest to seek scent, its head is carried high. Once it locates the birds, it will freeze on point or \"set\" indicating to its handler where the birds are hiding. It may slightly crouch but its position will remain tense, immobile and rigid. The dog's head will remain raised as it savours the airborne scent and it intently stares in the direction of where the birds are hiding. Its tail will be held level with its back. Setters literally show the hunters exactly where the birds are.The breed is classified in the Gundog Group by the Kennel Club in the U.K. and in the Sporting Group by the American and Canadian Kennel Clubs. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) classify the breed in Group 7 (Pointing dogs), Section 2 (British and Irish Pointers and Setters).The Irish Red and White Setter still has an ingrained natural working ability, so when correctly trained and given the appropriate opportunity, it will work well performing its original function.They can take longer to train than other gun dogs, but once trained, they are loyal and reliable companions. They need firm and decisive, but not harsh, training.,'Setting dogges' \u2013 an ancient term for setters, were developed to indicate the whereabouts of game birds, and would have been used in Roman times. The dog would find the location of the game birds by scenting the air, freeze in either a standing or crouching position, then slowly creep forward on command to disturb the birds into flight. Once the birds were in flight the hunter who had been following the dog would release hawks to capture the birds in the air. When netting superseded the use of hawks, setting dogs would still be used to indicate the whereabouts of the birds, but the hunter would come up behind the dog and throw a net over the birds. In the mid-1600s, guns became more readily available and shooting game birds became a popular pastime of the landed gentry. The basic work of setters was still to find and point to the location of game birds but it also had to be steady to shot." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4a9" }, "breed": "Irish Setter", "origin": "Ireland", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Setter", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Can_Setter_dog_GFDL.jpg/220px-Can_Setter_dog_GFDL.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6a6" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/irish_setter.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 5, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 3, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 5, "playfulness": 5, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 4, "energy": 5, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 15, "max_height_male": 27, "max_height_female": 27, "max_weight_male": 70, "max_weight_female": 60, "min_height_male": 27, "min_height_female": 27, "min_weight_male": 70, "min_weight_female": 60, "breed": "Irish Setter" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ee4" }, "breed": "Irish Setter", "contenido": "The Irish Setter (Irish: sotar rua, literally \"red setter\") is a setter, a breed of gundog, and family dog.

Like all sighthounds, it was used to pursue game by speed; it was also famed as a guardian dog, specializing in protection against and for the hunting of wolves.,The modern breed classified by recent genetic research into the Sighthound United Kingdom Rural Clade (Fig. S2), is used by coursing hunters who have prized it for its ability to dispatch game caught by other, swifter sighthounds. In 1902, the Irish Wolfhound was declared the regimental mascot of the Irish Guards.,In 391, there is a reference to large dogs by Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, a Roman Consul who received seven \"canes Scotici\" as a gift to be used for fighting lions and bears, and who wrote \"all Rome viewed (them) with wonder\". Scoti is a Latin name for the Gaels (ancient Irish). Dansey, the early 19th century translator of the first complete version of Arrian's work in English, On Coursing, suggested the Irish and Scottish \"greyhounds\" were derived from the same ancestor, the vertragus, and had expanded with the Scoti from Ireland across the Western Isles and into what is today Scotland.The dog-type is imagined by some to be very old. Wolfhounds were used as hunting dogs by the Gaels, who called them C\u00fa Faoil (Irish: C\u00fa Faoil [\u02ccku\u02d0 \u02c8f\u02e0i\u02d0l\u02b2], \"hound\" of \"wolf\" or wolfhound). Dogs are mentioned as c\u00fa in Irish laws and literature dating from the 6th century or, in the case of the Sagas, from the old Irish period, AD 600\u2013900. The word c\u00fa was often used as an epithet for warriors as well as kings, denoting that they were worthy of the respect and loyalty of a hound. C\u00fa Chulainn, a mythical warrior whose name means \"hound of Culann\", is supposed to have gained this name as a child when he slew the ferocious guard dog of Culann. As recompense he offered himself as a replacement.In discussing the systematic evidence of historic dog sizes in Ireland, the Irish zooarchaeologist Finbar McCormick stressed that no dogs of Irish Wolfhound size are known from sites of the Iron Age period of 1000 BC through to the early Christian period to 1200 AD, and on the basis of the historic dog bones available, dogs of current Irish Wolfhound size seem to be a relatively modern development: \"it must be concluded that the dog of C\u00faChulainn was no larger than an Alsatian and not the calf-sized beast of the popular imagination\".Hunting dogs were coveted and were frequently given as gifts to important personages and foreign nobles. King John of England, in about 1210, presented an Irish hound named Gelert to Llywelyn, the Prince of Wales. The poet The Hon William Robert Spencer immortalized this hound in a poem.In his Historie of Ireland completed 1571, Edmund Campion gives a description of the hounds used for hunting wolves in the Dublin and Wicklow mountains. He says: \"They (the Irish) are not without wolves and greyhounds to hunt them, bigger of bone and limb than a colt\". Due to their popularity overseas many were exported to European royal houses leaving numbers in Ireland depleted. This led to a declaration by Oliver Cromwell being published in Kilkenny on 27 April 1652 to ensure that sufficient numbers remained to control the wolf population.References to the Irish Wolfhound in the 18th century tell of its great size, strength and greyhound shape as well as its scarcity. Writing in 1790, Bewick described it as the largest and most beautiful of the dog kind; about 36 inches high, generally of a white or cinnamon colour, somewhat like the Greyhound but more robust. He said that their aspect was mild, disposition peaceful, and strength so great that in combat the Mastiff or Bulldog was far from being an equal to them.The last wolf in Ireland was killed in Co. Carlow in 1786. It is thought to have been killed at Myshall, on the slopes of Mount Leinster, by a pack of wolfdogs kept by a Mr Watson of Ballydarton. The wolfhounds that remained in the hands of a few families, who were mainly descendants of the old Irish chieftains, were now symbols of status rather than used as hunters, and these were said to be the last of their race.,Thomas Pennant (1726\u20131798) reported that he could find no more than three wolfdogs when he visited Ireland. During the 1836 meeting of the Geological Society of Dublin, Dr. Scouler presented the \"Notices of Animals which have disappeared from Ireland\", with the wolfdog mentioned." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4ad" }, "breed": "Istrian Coarse-haired Hound", "origin": "Croatia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istrian_Coarse-haired_Hound", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Istrian_hound2.jpg/220px-Istrian_hound2.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ee8" }, "breed": "Istrian Coarse-haired Hound", "contenido": "The Istrian Coarse-haired Hound (Croatian: istarski o\u0161trodlaki goni\u010d, Slovene: istrski ostrodlaki goni\u010d) is a dog breed from Croatia.

It is principally white-bodied and smooth, rough or broken-coated and can be any colour.,Small tan and white terriers that technically belong to other breeds are sometimes known erroneously as \"Jack Russells\". Each breed has different physical characteristics according to the standards of their national breed clubs; size and proportions are often used to tell them apart. Some authorities recognize a similar but separate breed as the Russell Terrier \u2013 a shorter-legged, stockier dog, with a range of 20\u201330 cm (8\u201312 in). However, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) regards the Russell terrier as a sub-type of Jack Russell terrier. Jack Russells are also frequently confused with the Parson Russell Terrier. Technically, the Parson Russell is usually larger and officially limited to a middle range, with a standard size of 30\u201336 cm (12\u201314 in), whereas the Jack Russell is a broader type, with a size range of 25\u201338 cm (10\u201315 in)Jack Russells are an energetic breed that rely on a high level of exercise and stimulation. They are relatively free from any serious health complaints. Originating from dogs bred and used by the Rev. John Russell in the early 19th century, from whom the breed takes its name, the Jack Russell has similar origins to the modern Fox Terrier. It has gone through several changes over the years, corresponding to different use and breed standards set by kennel clubs. Recognition by kennel clubs for the Jack Russell breed has been opposed by the breed's parent societies \u2013 which resulted in the breeding and recognition of the Parson Russell terrier. Jack Russells have appeared many times in film, television, and print \u2013 with several historical dogs of note.,The small white fox-working terriers we know today were first bred by the Reverend John Russell, a parson and hunting enthusiast born in 1795, and they can trace their origin to the now extinct English white terrier. Difficulty in differentiating the dog from the creature it was pursuing brought about the need for a mostly white dog, and so in 1819 during his last year of university at Exeter College, Oxford, he purchased a small white and tan terrier female named Trump from a local milkman in the nearby small hamlet of Elsfield or Marston. Trump epitomised his ideal fox terrier, which, at the time, was a term used for any terrier which was used to bolt foxes out of their burrows. Her colouring was described as \"...white, with just a patch of dark tan over each eye and ear; whilst a similar dot, not larger than a penny piece, marks the root of the tail.\" Davies, a friend of Russell's, wrote: \"Trump was such an animal as Russell had only seen in his dreams\". She was the basis for a breeding program to develop a terrier with high stamina for the hunt as well as the courage and formation to chase out foxes that had gone to ground. By the 1850s, these dogs were recognised as a distinct breed.An important attribute in this dog was a tempered aggressiveness that would provide the necessary drive to pursue and bolt the fox, without resulting in physical harm to the quarry and effectively ending the chase, which was considered unsporting. Russell was said to have prided himself that his terriers never tasted blood. This line of terriers developed by John Russell was well respected for those qualities, and his dogs were often taken on by hunt enthusiasts. It is unlikely, however, that any dogs alive today can be proved to be descendants from Trump, as Russell was forced to sell all his dogs on more than one occasion because of financial difficulty, and had only four aged (and non-breeding) terriers left when he died in 1883.The Fox terrier and Jack Russell terrier type dogs of today are all descended from dogs of that period. However, documented pedigrees earlier than 1862 have not been found. Several records remain of documented breeding by John Russell between the 1860s and 1880s. The Fox Terrier Club was formed in 1875 with Russell as one of the founder members; its breed standard was aspiration, and not a description of how the breed appeared then. By the start of the 20th century, the Fox Terrier had altered more towards the modern breed, but in some parts of the country the old style of John Russell's terriers remained, and it is from those dogs that the modern Jack Russell type has descended.Many breeds can claim heritage to the early Fox Terrier of this period, including the Brazilian Terrier, Japanese Terrier, Miniature Fox Terrier, Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz, Rat Terrier, and Tenterfield Terrier.,Following Russell's death, the only people who made serious efforts to continue those strains were two men, one in Chislehurst with the surname of East, and another in Cornwall named Archer. East, at one point, had several couples, all of which were descended from one of Russell's dogs. The type aimed for were not as big as the show Fox Terrier and were usually less than 7 kg (15 lb).Arthur Blake Heinemann created the first breed standard and, in 1894, he founded the Devon and Somerset Badger Club, the aims of which were to promote badger digging rather than fox hunting, and the breeding of terriers suitable for this purpose. Terriers were acquired from Nicholas Snow of Oare, and they were likely descended from Russell's original dogs, as Russell would probably have hunted at some point with Snow's hunting club and is likely to have provided at least some of their original terriers. By the turn of the 20th century, Russell's name had become associated with this breed of dog.The club was later renamed the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club. Badger digging required a different type of dog than fox hunting, and it is likely that Bull Terrier stock was introduced to strengthen the breed, which may have caused the creation of a shorter legged variety of Jack Russell terrier that started to appear around this period. At the same time that a split was appearing between show and working Fox terriers, a further split was occurring between two different types of white terrier, both carrying Jack Russell's name. Heinemann was invited to judge classes for working terriers at Crufts with an aim to bring working terriers back into the show ring and influence those that disregard working qualities in dogs. These classes were continued for several years by various judges, but Charles Cruft dropped the attempt as the classes were never heavily competed. Following Heinemann's death in 1930, the kennel and leadership of the club passed to Annie Harris, but the club itself folded shortly before World War II." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4b2" }, "breed": "Japanese Chin", "origin": null, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Chin", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Chin_posing.jpg/220px-Chin_posing.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6ac" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/japanese_chin.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 5, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 3, "energy": 3, "barking": 2, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 12, "max_height_male": 11, "max_height_female": 11, "max_weight_male": 11, "max_weight_female": 11, "min_height_male": 8, "min_height_female": 8, "min_weight_male": 7, "min_weight_female": 7, "breed": "Japanese Chin" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5eed" }, "breed": "Japanese Chin", "contenido": "The Japanese Chin (Japanese: \u72c6, chin), also known as the Japanese Spaniel, is a dog known for its strabismus of the eyes.

Kooikers were popular in the 17th and 18th century and appear in the paintings of Rembrandt and Jan Steen. The breed is gaining popularity in the United States, Canada and Scandinavia, where it is still relatively unknown.,The Kooikerhondje is a small, flashy, orange and white spaniel-like sporting dog. Originally bred in the Netherlands as a duck decoy dog, its heavily white plumed tail waves jauntily to entice and lure ducks to follow it into Eendenkooi (elaborate manmade pond trapping systems). When not working the traps, Kooikers were expected to work on the farm to catch vermin.,The preferred height at the withers is 40 CM (16 inches in the U.S.) for males and 38 CM (15 inches in the U.S.) for females. The FCI standard allows variation of 38 to 41 CM for males, 36 to 39 CM for females. Allowable size in the United States is 14.5 to 17.5 inches for males, 13.5 to 16.5 inches for females. The proportion of the Kooiker is off-square. The bone and substance of the Kooiker is moderate.  The head should be in proportion to the dog.  The expression is gentle and alert. Ears should be orange-red in color and well feathered and ideally adorned with earrings. The color for the Kooiker should preferably be distinct patches of clear orange-red on pure white, although a few small spots on the legs are acceptable. Color should be predominate on the back with the chest, belly, blaze and the majority of the legs and tail white. Black ears. A black tail ring where the color changes from orange-red to white is permitted. A dog who is solid red on the back is acceptable but not preferred.,Kooikerhondjes are cheerful, good natured, friendly, quiet, well-behaved, and alert. Depending on its domestic environment, it is kind, happy and lively. They are also intelligent, attentive and more than willing to please their owner. The Kooikerhondje adapts to situations rather quickly, changing his behavior from quiet to lively when the situation allows them to be. They will not always immediately like strangers, instead choosing to retreat.

The Koolie is a working or herding dog which has existed in Australia since the early 19th century when it was bred from imported British working dogs. Robert Kaleski, in an article on Cattle Dogs in the August 1903 issue of the Agricultural Gazette of New South Wales, describes the \"Welsh heeler or merle, erroneously known as the German collie,\" as a \"blue-gray dog about the size and build of a smooth-haired collie, generally with wall eyes.\"  The British background predominated in the dogs that came to be associated with the \"German collie\" name.,There is substantial variation in the Koolie population, as Koolies were bred to exhibit different characteristics in different regions. The breed is based on its ability to work rather than on its conformation. However, most Koolie breeders refer to the Koolie as a breed rather than as a type, and assert that it \"breeds true\", with various types or strains.,The Koolie is a \"herding dog\", one which has a natural instinct to circle widely round sheep and bring them back to their owner. Koolies are known as silent, upright, working dogs. They are used for herding sheep and also for quiet careful work at close quarters at lambing time or for \"shedding\" (cutting out) sheep.,With the demand for farming dogs no longer being what it was, the Koolie has proven it\u2019s worth in many other fields where it is renowned for its sensitivity, athleticism and obedience, excelling in agility, tracking, therapy, disability & emotional support service, and as the ultimate outdoor & family companion, providing they are well trained. ,The Koolie is as diverse as the country it originates from, Australia. In the north of Queensland and New South Wales they are tall, medium boned and agile, bred for mustering cattle over many miles. In New South Wales, they are thicker set and shorter to flush low lying cattle from the dense bush and gullies. In Victoria, one finds the smallest variety of the Koolie, primarily used for sheep. Koolies are bred to meet the needs of the stockman, grazier and farmer; all agile, all with the same ability to adapt to any situation, all with a strong willingness drive. The Koolie vary from 40 to 60 centimetres (16 to 24 in) in size and are a contrast of coat, colour and body type. Most often, they are seen in the merle coat pattern, but can exhibit any combination of colour and coat lengths. The solid red or black Koolie are often mistaken for Kelpies, and some bi-coloured Koolie have been taken for Border Collies by the general public. As all of these breeds share Collie ancestry, they resemble each other." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4d1" }, "breed": "Lhasa Apso", "origin": "Tibet (China)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lhasa_Apso", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Aishia.jpg/220px-Aishia.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6bb" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/lhasa_apso.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 1, "grooming": 3, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 5, "trainability": 3, "energy": 3, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 15, "max_height_male": 11, "max_height_female": 11, "max_weight_male": 18, "max_weight_female": 18, "min_height_male": 10, "min_height_female": 10, "min_weight_male": 12, "min_weight_female": 12, "breed": "Lhasa Apso" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f15" }, "breed": "Lhasa Apso", "contenido": "The Lhasa Apso ( LAH-s\u0259 AP-soh) is a non-sporting dog breed originating in Tibet.

Their diminutive size, short clean hair and loyal acceptance of their place in the social hierarchy make them good pets, particularly in households with small children.

Many historians and those who have researched the background of the breed agree that this heritage is most likely correct, adding the shorthaired German Pinscher to the family tree. The international kennel club, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, lists the Miniature Pinscher in Group 2, Section 1.1 Pinscher, along with the Dobermann, the German Pinscher, the Austrian Pinscher, and the other Toy Pinscher, the Affenpinscher. Other kennel clubs list the Miniature Pinscher in the Toy Group or Companion Group.,The misconception that the Miniature Pinscher is a \"miniature Doberman\" occurred because the Doberman Pinscher (a breed developed by Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann around 1890) was introduced to the U.S. before the Miniature Pinscher. In 1919, the Miniature Pinscher was introduced to the AKC show ring. At the time, not knowing that it was referred to officially in Germany as the Zwergpinscher (little biter), the AKC referred to the breed as simply \"Pinscher\" and listed it in the miscellaneous category. When the Miniature Pinscher Club of America (MPCA) was created in 1929 (the year of the breed's official introduction into the AKC), they petitioned for Miniature Pinschers to be placed in the Toy group. The AKC's description, that the dog \"must appear as a Doberman in miniature,\" led to the misconception common today that this breed is a \"Miniature Doberman Pinscher\".,The original name for this breed in the U.S. was \"Pinscher (Toy)\" until 1972 when the name was officially changed to Miniature Pinscher.,Documentation of this breed begins less than 200 years ago. There is a drawing by Jean Bungartz, published in 1888 comparing the Miniature Pinscher to the German Pinscher.,The Miniature Pinscher is structurally a well balanced, sturdy, compact, short-coupled, smooth-coated dog. They are naturally well groomed, vigorous and alert. Characteristic traits are their hackney-like action, fearless animation, complete self-possession, and spirited presence. Legs should be straight with no bending in or out. They are also known to have separation anxiety.

Miniature Schnauzers may have been developed from the smallest specimens of the Standard Schnauzer, or crosses between the standard and one or more smaller breeds such as the Affenpinscher, Miniature Pinscher, and Poodles, as farmers bred a small dog that was an efficient ratting dog. They are described as \"spunky\" but aloof dogs, with good guarding tendencies without some guard dogs' predisposition to bite. Miniature Schnauzers are recognized in four colors internationally: solid black, black and silver, salt and pepper, and white.It is the most popular Schnauzer breed, and remains one of the most popular worldwide, primarily for its temperament and relatively small size. As of 2020 it is the 19th most popular breed in the U.S.,The earliest records surrounding the development of the Standard Schnauzer in Germany come from the late 19th century. They were originally bred to be medium-sized farm dogs in Germany, equally suited to ratting, herding, and guarding property. As time passed, farmers bred the Standard Schnauzer into a smaller, more compact size for ratting by combining it, according to cynologist theorization, with one or more small breeds such as the Affenpinscher and Miniature Poodle, Miniature Pinscher, or Pomeranian, or by chance from smallest specimens of the Standard Schnauzer. The first recorded Miniature Schnauzer appeared in 1888, black female named Findel, and the Pinscher-Schnauzer Klub (formed in 1895) in its first volume of the club's stud book mentioned Wirehaired Miniature Pinscher. The first exhibition was held in 1899.,The American Kennel Club accepted registration of the new breed in 1926, two years after Miniature Schnauzers were introduced to the United States. The American Miniature Schnauzer Club was formed in 1933, from the older parent club Wire-Haired Pinscher Club of America which also included Standard Schnauzer, and initially both competed in the Working Group until 1927. International Kennel Club classifications vary; by the VDH and FCI it is placed in \"Group 2, Section 1: Pinschers and Schnauzers\", with \"Nr. 183\" in \"Section 1.2\" dedicated to the Miniature Schnauzer breed, the KC, ANKC and NZKC include it in the Utility Group, while by the AKC, UKC and CKC the Miniature Schnauzer is classed in the Terrier Group.The start of the modern Miniature Schnauzer in the United States is considered to have a beginning in 1924 when four dogs were imported from Germany. It is argued that almost all American-bred Miniatures partly descend from them, and between 1926 and 1936, 108 more dogs were imported. One of the most notable champions was Ch. Dorem Display, born in 1945 and lived to be nearly fourteen. It is claimed that many champion Miniature Schnauzers in America can trace its lineage back to Dorem Display.Miniature Schnauzers were the 11th most popular breed in the U.S. in 2008, falling to 17th most popular in 2016.,Miniature Schnauzers have a very square-shaped build, measuring 11 to 14 inches (28 to 36 cm) tall and weighing 10 to 15 pounds (4.5 to 6.8 kg) for females and 11 to 18 pounds (5.0 to 8.2 kg) for males. They have a double coat, with wiry exterior fur and a soft undercoat. In show trim, the coat is kept short on the body, but the fur on the ears, legs, belly, and face is retained. Recognized coat colors are black, pepper and salt, black and silver, and pure white; pepper and salt coloration is where coat hairs have banded shades of black, gray and silver, fading to a gray or silver at the eyebrows, whiskers, underbody and legs.Miniature Schnauzers are often described as non-moulting dogs, and while this is not entirely true, their shedding is minimal and generally unnoticeable. For this reason, Schnauzers are considered a hypoallergenic breed. They are characterized by a rectangular head with bushy beard, mustache, and eyebrows; teeth that meet in a \"scissor bite\"; oval and dark colored eyes; and v-shaped, natural forward-folding ears (when cropped, the ears point straight upward and come to a sharp point). Their tails are naturally thin and short, and may be docked (where permitted). They will also have very straight, rigid front legs, and feet that are short and round (so-called \"cat feet\") with thick, black pads.,Docking of tails and cropping of ears has become a controversial practice, especially for non-working dogs, and is now illegal or restricted in a number of countries worldwide, including the UK and Australia." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4eb" }, "breed": "Norwegian Lundehund", "origin": "Norway", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Lundehund", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Lundehund-2003.jpg/220px-Lundehund-2003.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6ca" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/norwegian_lundehund.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 3, "energy": 3, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 15, "max_height_male": 15, "max_height_female": 15, "max_weight_male": 30, "max_weight_female": 30, "min_height_male": 13, "min_height_female": 13, "min_weight_male": 20, "min_weight_female": 20, "breed": "Norwegian Lundehund" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f3c" }, "breed": "Norwegian Lundehund", "contenido": "The Norwegian Lundehund (Norsk lundehund) is a small dog breed of the Spitz type that originates from Norway. Its name is a compound noun composed of the elements lunde, meaning puffin (Norwegian lunde, \"puffin\", or lundefugl, \"puffin bird\"), and hund, meaning dog. The breed was originally developed for the hunting of puffins and their eggs on inaccessible nesting places on cliffs and in caves.,The Norwegian Lundehund is a small, rectangular Spitz type dog. The Lundehund has a great range of motion in its joints, allowing it to fit into and extricate itself from narrow passages.  Dogs of this breed are able to bend their head backwards along their own spine, similar to New Guinea Singing dog, Bornean dingo and Australian dingo, and turn their forelegs to the side at a 90-degree horizontal angle to their body, much like human arms. Their pricked, upright ears can be folded shut to form a near-tight seal by folding forward or backward.,The Norwegian Lundehund is a polydactyl: instead of the normal four toes per foot, the Lundehund normally has six toes, all fully formed, jointed and muscled. Some specimens may on occasion have more or fewer than six toes per foot, but this is then outside the breed standard. ,The outercoat is dense and rough with a soft undercoat. The Lundehund is adapted to climb narrow cliff paths in V\u00e6r\u00f8y where it originally would have hunted puffins. Some general information can be found on the Norwegian Lundehund Association webpages.,The Lundehund was a valuable working animal for hunting puffin birds along the Norwegian coast as food for over 400 years. Its flexibility and extra toes were ideal for hunting the birds in their inaccessible nesting locations on cliffs and in caves. Interest for the breed declined when new methods for hunting puffins were incorporated and a dog tax was created. Around 1900, they were only found in the isolated village of Mostad (spelled M\u00e5stad in Norwegian), Lofoten. There have also been stories of Lundehund being used on Lovund, Lur\u00f8y by Petter Dass, as cited in his famous work, Nordlands Trompet. The breed was nearly extinct around World War II when canine distemper struck V\u00e6r\u00f8y and the surrounding islands.  In 1963, the population was further decimated by another outbreak of distemper.  This time, only six dogs survived, one on V\u00e6r\u00f8y and five in eastern Norway, Hamar. The latter five were from the same mother. This created a population bottleneck. Due to careful breeding with strict guidelines, there are now an estimated 1400 dogs in the world (2010), with around 600 of the population in Norway and ~350 in the United States.,The breed is being tested in Troms\u00f8 airport by the Norwegian Air Traffic and Airport Management as a solution to airplane bird strikes.

It is often referred to as a \"toller\". It is the smallest of the retrievers, and is often mistaken for a small Golden Retriever. Tollers are intelligent, eager to please, alert, and energetic. The name \"toller\" is derived from their ability to lure waterfowl within gunshot range. The breed originated in Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia, Canada. The American Kennel Club ranks the toller as the 87th most popular dog breed.,The breed was developed in the Acadian community of Little River Harbour in Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia, around the beginning of the 19th century. The toller was originally referred to as the Little River Duck Dog before being officially recognized by the Canadian Kennel Club in 1945 as a purebred dog. The toller is a mixture of retrievers, spaniels, setters, and possibly a farm collie mongrel, although this has yet to be confirmed. The breed was perfected in the second half of the 19th century.The breed gained national recognition in 1980, and was declared the provincial dog of Nova Scotia in 1995, when two Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers were awarded Best in Show at championship events that included many breeds.,Tollers are named for their ability to entice or lure waterfowl within gunshot range, called \"tolling\". The hunter stays hidden in a blind and sends the dog out to romp and play near the water, usually by tossing a ball or stick to be retrieved. The dog's appearance is similar to that of a fox.

It is common in Brazil, where it was first recognized by a national kennel club. The dogs were used to track, capture, and hunt deer (pampas deer), and thus earned the name Pampas Deerhound (in Brazilian Portuguese \"Veadeiro pampeano\": veadeiro = deer-hound; pampeano = those who came from the pampas). It is still a widely preferred hunting companion to track other animals, such as wild boars.,The Pampas Deerhound comes from a lineage which is different from the National Deerhound (Veadeiro Nacional), despite the similarity in the two names. Both breeds are recognized in Brazil by the SOBRACI as being distinct from each other.,The Pampas Deerhound was originally known as Veadeiro, Cervero or Bianchini (meaning \"whiteness, white, or pale\" in Italian). Characteristics of this dog breed have remained stable for a long time courtesy of inbreeding program between dogs that exhibited desirable hunting traits. In 2000, thanks largely to the efforts of the late Carlos Lafaiete Seibert Bacelar, this dog breed was finally granted official recognition by the Brazilian Confederation of Cynophilia (CBKC). However, it is still not recognized by any Uruguayan or Argentinean kennel club. Currently, Brazilian breeders of this dog breed are in the process of seeking recognition from FCI.,Origin of the Veadeiro is shrouded in mystery owing to inconclusive evidence. There are, however, two hypotheses that emerge as being the most probable. The first presumes that this dog is a descendant of a group of primitive dogs, such as Podengos or Podencos Ibicencos, which had been brought to South America when Brazil and Uruguay were Portuguese colonies. Later on these canines were taken to the Argentinian border by hunters. These primitive dogs were widely employed for subsistence hunting in rural areas. They eventually adapted to the new climate, and through cross-breeding, a new lineage originated. Selective breeding by hunters may have contributed towards the evolution of this breed and the gradual development of its traits. Studies conducted by Carlos Bacelar revealed that a family of Pampas Deerhound breeders began breeding Veadeiros for hunting from up to four generations ago.The second hypothesis is that this dog breed was a native of South America. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the dog is a common feature in several regions of Brazil, especially in the south and central-west, and also in certain parts of northern Argentina and northern Uruguay. In the pampas region of these three countries, the official name of \"Pampas\" Deerhound was adopted because it was believed that presence of this breed was restricted only to the gaucho pampas region and to a lesser extent in the Argentine and Uruguayan pampas. Its widespread presence was later recorded in other regions of Brazil. Most of the specimens that have been found to conform to the defined ideal standard are being identified through microchips. It is hoped that this will help create definite bloodlines formed by unrelated couples. This in turn would aid in forming the family tree of the breed which is a prerequisite to achieve the international recognition.There are some similarities between the Pampas Deerhound and the Rajapalayam dog that is native to the region of that name in India. Brazil was previously a colony of Portugal. At the same time, India had certain regions under Portuguese dominance for centuries. These formed a part of major maritime trade routes connecting the continents and, thus explaining the presence of a variation of this dog breed in Brazil.,While hunting, the Pampas Deerhound is a relentless pursuer that is not intimidated by obstacles. They are excellent sniffers. After identifying the trail, the canine can follow the prey relentlessly without a break, even if it takes two days to track down. After finding its prey, the dog knocks it down and brings it to the hunter. If for some reason the dog is unable to bring down its prey, it fences the target till it is within the reach of the hunter. Throughout the duration of hunting, the dog could howl, or emit different sounds for each situation: one while finding the trail, another while losing it, and yet another when it is close to the prey. This dog can hunt alone, in pairs, in packs, or with its owner. They are superb hunters, and are frequently used for hunting deer and wild boars. As they are relatively agile, they can also hunt hares and Brazilian guinea pig.Due to their ability to hunt in packs, these dogs have a quiet demeanor, and they also make excellent companions. They are valued for being very docile and friendly with children, wherein they show patience and remain calm in the company of active children. They are also very attached to their owners and make excellent watchdogs that would alert their masters to the presence of strangers by barking. While the breed's intelligence and agility, in some cases, has been appreciated in context of activities like sheep and cattle herding, it is still regarded as having an inherent aptitude for hunting." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4ff" }, "breed": "Perro de Presa Mallorquin", "origin": "Spain (Majorca)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ca_de_Bou", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/ZarcoBruno2015.jpg/220px-ZarcoBruno2015.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f54" }, "breed": "Perro de Presa Mallorquin", "contenido": "The Ca de Bou, also known as the Perro de Presa Mallorquin or the Majorcan Bulldog, is a breed of bulldog type dogs from Majorca, the largest of the Balearic Islands.,The Ca de Bou was historically kept on the island of Majorca for the blood sports of bull-baiting and dog fighting.

Originally, these dogs were used for hunting birds - Great bustards. The Polish Greyhound was the favorite dog of the Polish nobility.After World War II, breeding of this breed disappeared.

The coat is somewhat heavier than a Greyhound's. They have an undercoat that gets thicker in the winter. Polish Greyhounds have a long brush on the tail and have culottes at the rear of the thighs.

Classed as a toy dog breed because of its small size, the Pomeranian is descended from larger Spitz-type dogs, specifically the German Spitz. It has been determined by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale to be part of the German Spitz breed; and in many countries, they are known as the Zwergspitz (\"Dwarf Spitz\").,The breed has been made popular by a number of royal owners since the 18th century. Queen Victoria owned a particularly small Pomeranian and consequently, the smaller variety became universally popular. During Queen Victoria's lifetime alone, the size of the breed decreased by half. Overall, the Pomeranian is a sturdy, healthy dog. The most common health issues are luxating patella and tracheal collapse. More rarely, the breed can have Alopecia X, a skin condition colloquially known as \"black skin disease\". This is a genetic disease which causes the dog's skin to turn black and lose all or most of its hair. As of 2017, in terms of registration figures, since at least 1998, the breed has ranked among the top fifty most popular breeds in the United States, and the current fashion for small dogs has increased their popularity worldwide.,Pomeranians are small dogs weighing 1.36\u20133.17 kilograms (3.0\u20137.0 lb) and standing 8\u201314 inches (20\u201336 cm) high at the withers. They are compact but sturdy dogs with an abundant textured coat with a highly plumed tail set high and flat. The top coat forms a ruff of fur on the neck, which Poms are well known for, and they also have a fringe of feathery hair on the hindquarters.The earliest examples of the breed were white or occasionally brown or black. Queen Victoria adopted a small red Pomeranian in 1888, which caused that color to become fashionable by the end of the 19th century. In modern times, the Pomeranian comes in the widest variety of colors of any dog breed, including white, black, brown, red, orange, cream, blue, sable, black and tan, brown and tan, spotted, brindle, and parti, plus combinations of those colors. The most common colors are orange, black, or cream/white.The merle Pomeranian is a recent colour developed by breeders. It is a combination of a solid base colour with a lighter blue/grey patch which gives a mottled effect. The most common base colours for the effect are red/brown or black, although it can also appear with other colours. Combinations such as brindle merle or liver merle are not accepted in the breed standard. In addition, the eye, nose and paw pad are marshmallow color, changing parts of the eye to blue and the color on the nose and paw pads to become mottled pink and black.Pomeranians have a thick double coat. While grooming is not difficult, breeders recommend that it be done daily to maintain the quality of the coat and because of its thickness and the constant shedding, with trimming every 1\u20132 months. The outer coat is long, straight, and harsh in texture while the undercoat is soft, thick and short. The coat knots and tangles easily, particularly when the undercoat is being shed, which happens twice a year." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c511" }, "breed": "Porcelaine", "origin": "France", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcelaine", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Porcelaine_2009_pl4.jpg/220px-Porcelaine_2009_pl4.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6e3" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/porcelaine.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 5, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 1, "drooling": 3, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 5, "playfulness": 5, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 5, "energy": 4, "barking": 2, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 13, "max_height_male": 23, "max_height_female": 23, "max_weight_male": 62, "max_weight_female": 62, "min_height_male": 22, "min_height_female": 22, "min_weight_male": 55, "min_weight_female": 55, "breed": "Porcelaine" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f6b" }, "breed": "Porcelaine", "contenido": "The Porcelaine [p\u0254\u0281s\u0259l\u025bn] is a breed of dog originating from France.

Its forebears can be traced to the semi-domesticated ridged hunting dogs of the Khoikhoi. These were crossed with European dogs by the early colonists of the Cape Colony of southern Africa. The original breed standard was drafted by F. R. Barnes, in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia  (now Zimbabwe), in 1922, who named the breed the Rhodesian Ridgeback. The standard was approved by the South African Kennel Union in 1927. The Rhodesian Ridgeback at present is the only registered breed indigenous to Southern Africa.,The Khoikhoi people who lived the Cape Peninsula when the Dutch began trading with the area during the mid 17th century, had a semi-wild hunting dog which was described by Europeans as absolutely fearless and ferocious when acting as a guard dog. This dog measured approximately 18 inches (46 cm) at the withers, with a lean but muscular frame. The ears have been described both as erect but later described as hanging due to interbreeding with European dogs, but the most distinctive feature was the length of hair often growing in the reverse direction along its back. Within 53 years of the first Dutch settlements in Southern Africa, the Europeans were using these local dogs themselves.By the early 1800s, European colonists had also imported a variety of mainly European dog breeds to this area of Africa, including such dedicated hunting dogs as Great Danes, Bloodhounds and Greyhounds. The Dogo Cubano (Cuban Bloodhound), an extinct breed used for dogfighting and guarding, was highly emphasised in the composition of the early Ridgeback. Genetic analysis indicates that the Ridgeback and the Great Dane fall within the same genetic clade (group), which implies the Dane's major contribution. These breeds were bred with the indigenous African dogs, including the dog of the Khoikhoi people, which resulted in the Boer hunting dogs, generically called names such as boerhond (Boer hound) in Dutch; then its descendant language of Afrikaans, which are the chief forerunners to the modern Rhodesian Ridgeback. The sequencing of ancient dog genomes indicates that the southern African Rhodesian Ridgeback retains 4% pre-colonial ancestry.The Rev. Charles Helm (1844\u20131915), son of the Rev. Daniel Helm of the London Missionary Society, was born in the Cape Colony, joined the London Missionary Society himself, and moved from the Zuurbraak (now Suurbraak) mission station just east of Swellendam (modern Western Cape Province, South Africa) to the Hope Fountain Mission in Matabeleland, Southern Rhodesia, travelling from October 1874 to December 1875, then bringing two ridged dog bitches from somewhere between Kimberley (modern Northern Cape Province, South Africa) and Swellendam with him to Hope Fountain in 1879 en route to becoming, as it would turn out, a political advisor to King Lobengula, house-host to hunter-explorer Frederick Courteney Selous, postmaster of Bulawayo and well-appreciated tooth-extractor. At Hope Fountain, now part of the city of Bulawayo, fellow South African transplant Cornelis van Rooyen (b. 1860, Uitenhage, modern Eastern Cape Province, South Africa), a big\u2013game hunter, was married to Maria Vermaak of Bloemhof by Charles Helm in 1879 the same year Helm brought his two rough-coated grey-black bitches to the Mission. Van Rooyen saw Helm's pair of bitches and decided to breed his own dogs with them to incorporate their guarding abilities.After initially greyer, rough-coated litters originating from Helm's dogs, van Rooyen's subsequently crossed offspring turned to redder coats, incorporating the Khoikhoi landrace dog's ridges already carried in Boer dogs within his genomes. They became the foundation stock of a kennel which developed dogs over the next 35 years with the ability to bay a lion, to not attack it outright but to harass it by darting in and out with quick snaps and confusing the animal until the hunter shot it. These dogs were used to clear farmland of  wild pigs and baboons, and they can kill a baboon independently of a human hunter's collaboration.The original breed standard was drafted in 1922 by F. R. Barnes on founding the first Ridgeback Club at a Bulawayo Kennel Club show, then in Southern Rhodesia (now in Zimbabwe), and based on that of the Dalmatian. In 1927, Barnes' standard was approved by the South African Kennel Union. Outside the subcontinent and internationally, the first Rhodesian Ridgebacks in Britain were shown by Mrs. Edward Foljambe in 1928. In 1950, Mr. and Mrs. William H. O'Brien of Arizona brought six carefully selected Ridgebacks to the US from South Africa. He and his wife and Margaret Lowthian of California began the process of getting the breed accepted by the American Kennel Club. Similarly, in 1952, The Rhodesian Ridgeback Club of Great Britain was founded at Crufts to promote the breed around the United Kingdom to show judges, so a standard for the breed might be recognised. In 1954 the first Challenge Certificates were awarded to dogs shown as Rhodesian Ridgebacks at United Kingdom competitions, toward their subsequent recognition by The Kennel Club of Great Britain, and in 1955 the American Kennel Club recognised the Rhodesian Ridgeback breed as a member of the hound group.,The Rhodesian ridgeback is the mascot and the Ontario Tech Ridgebacks are the intercollegiate athletic teams of Ontario Tech University in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada.,The appearance standard of the Ridgeback originated in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and goes back to the year 1922, and by 2019 this standard had remained virtually unchanged. The Rhodesian Ridgeback's distinguishing feature is the ridge of hair running along its back in the opposite direction from the rest of its coat. It consists of a fan-like area formed by two whorls of hair (called \"crowns\") and tapers from immediately behind the shoulders down to the level of the hips. The ridge is usually about 2 inches (51 mm) in width at its widest point. It is believed to originate from the dog used by the original African dog population which had a similar ridge.,Male ridgebacks usually stand 25\u201327 in (64\u201369 cm) at the withers and weigh about 40 kg (88 lb) (FCI standard); females are typically 24\u201326 inches (61\u201366 cm) tall and about 32 kg (71 lb) in weight. Ridgebacks are typically very muscular and have a light wheaten to red wheaten coat, which should be short, dense, sleek and glossy in appearance, and neither woolly nor silky.White is acceptable on the chest and toes. The presence of black guard hairs or ticking is not addressed in the AKC standard, although the elaboration of the AKC standard notes the amount of black or dark brown in the coat should not be excessive. The FCI standard states that excessive black hairs throughout the coat are highly undesirable. Ridgebacks sometimes have a dark mask. The dog's nose should be black or liver in keeping with the colour of the dog. No other coloured nose is permissible. The brown nose is a recessive gene. It is not as common as a black nose; some breeders believe the inclusion of brown noses in a breeding program is necessary for maintaining the vibrancy of the coat. The eyes should be round and should reflect the dog's colour: dark eyes with a black nose, amber eyes with a brown (liver) nose." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c52a" }, "breed": "Romanian Mioritic Shepherd Dog", "origin": "Romania", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Mioritic_Shepherd_Dog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Mioritic.jpg/220px-Mioritic.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6f1" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/romanian_mioritic_shepherd_dog.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 2, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 3, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 1, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 5, "trainability": 3, "energy": 3, "barking": 1, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 14, "max_height_male": 29, "max_height_female": 29, "max_weight_male": 130, "max_weight_female": 130, "min_height_male": 27, "min_height_female": 27, "min_weight_male": 100, "min_weight_female": 100, "breed": "Romanian Mioritic Shepherd Dog" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f86" }, "breed": "Romanian Mioritic Shepherd Dog", "contenido": "The Romanian Mioritic Shepherd (Romanian: Ciob\u0103nesc Rom\u00e2nesc Mioritic) is a large breed of livestock guardian dog that originated in the Carpathian Mountains of Romania.,The male Mioritic stands about 70\u201375 centimetres (28\u201330 in) tall at the withers with the female slightly smaller at 65\u201370 centimetres (26\u201328 in).

There are two types of coats in the breed: smooth coat and long coat. The smooth-coated variety was previously known as the Russian Toy Terrier and long-coated as the Moscow Long-Haired Toy Terrier. Both were brought together under the same Russian Toy Terrier name in 1988 and the \"Terrier\" was dropped from the name when the breed was added in 2006 to the official list of breeds registered with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale and has been registered in the Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club since 2008, allowed to compete in AKC companion events since 2010. The first official breed standard of the two varieties was written in 1966 in Russia.The breed was nearly wiped out twice; first in the 1920s with the rise of Communism due to the toy dog's traditional link to the aristocracy and again in the 1990s with the influx of foreign breeds following the fall of the Iron Curtain. The smooth coat type is the older of the two, with the long coat type first appearing in 1958.,Until the 1990s, the breed was almost unknown outside of Russia, and so relatively few details on associated health issues are known. The Russian Toy was originally bred as a rat fighter and as a watchdog, and can still exhibit the vocalization expected from the latter. It is a friendly dog and can become very attached to the family unit. Due to its size and similarities to the Chihuahua, the two are often compared.,The Russian Toy is one of the smallest breeds in the world, measuring between 20 cm and 28 cm and weighing anywhere between 1,5 kg and 3 kg. It has a small, distinctive head with large eyes and triangular ears. In countries where docking is prohibited, the tail is curved in the shape of a sickle. There are two types in the breed, distinguished by their coats; one is long-coated and the other smooth-coated. The smooth-coated dog has a short, shiny, close-lying coat. The long-coated variety has a longer coat and profuse feathering in the ears, legs and tail. The feathering or \"fringe\" on the ears is usually 3 to 5 cm long, can be straight or with a slight wave. It will be grown by the age of three and should completely cover the outer edges and tips of the ears.The smooth coat type of the breed closely resembles the Pra\u017esk\u00fd Krysa\u0159\u00edk breed of the Czech Republic. The Pra\u017esk\u00fd on average is a little shorter on leg and a little heavier than the Russian Toy.,Both of the Russian Toy varieties can be crossed and produce smooth- and long-coated puppies from the same litter. In addition, when two smooth-coated dogs are bred together, they may occasionally bear a long-coated offspring if the long hair gene is present in their pedigrees. However, there have been no records of two long-coated Russian Toys breeding together and producing smooth-coated offspring.,The breed has four main colors: black and tan, blue and tan, brown and tan, and solid red of various shades. Red includes sable (red where the tips of the hairs are black, known as overlay) and red sable (red with brown overlay).,A Russian Toy will often require the help of a veterinarian to remove any retained deciduous teeth (known as \"puppy teeth\" or \"baby teeth\") that fail to fall out and make way for the permanent teeth. Without this intervention, usually done under anesthetic, the baby and permanent teeth will occupy the same socket in the jaw, which can cause tartar deposits, tooth decay, gingivitis and periodontitis, and can lead to premature loss of teeth. Retained puppy teeth can also cause misalignment of the teeth.As with most breeds of dog, the Russian Toy can suffer from patellar luxation, which is where the knee cap slips out of place when the knee bends as the groove that normally holds it in place is too shallow. It is usually an inherited defect, which occurs during the development of the foetus and rarely by trauma.Russian Toys can suffer from bone fractures due to their small and sometimes delicate nature." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c533" }, "breed": "Saluki", "origin": "Fertile Crescent", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saluki", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Red_Smooth_Saluki.jpg/220px-Red_Smooth_Saluki.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6f4" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/saluki.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 2, "grooming": 1, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 1, "trainability": 3, "energy": 4, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 17, "max_height_male": 28, "max_height_female": 28, "max_weight_male": 65, "max_weight_female": 65, "min_height_male": 23, "min_height_female": 23, "min_weight_male": 40, "min_weight_female": 40, "breed": "Saluki" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f97" }, "breed": "Saluki", "contenido": "The Saluki, also known as the Persian Greyhound, is a standardised breed developed from sighthounds \u2013 dogs that hunt primarily by sight rather than scent \u2013 that was once used by nomadic tribes to run down game animals. The dog was originally bred in the Fertile Crescent. The modern breed is typically deep-chested and long-legged, and similar dogs appear in medieval and ancient art. The breed is most closely related to the Afghan hound, a basal breed that predates the emergence of modern breeds in the 19th century, and the Saluki has been purebred both in the Middle East, including by royalty, since at least that era, and in the West (especially in Britain and Germany) since the 1840s (with breed standards established in the West and the Middle East around the 1920s\u20131930s), though as a free-breeding landrace, similar dogs are common as feral animals in the Middle East. A related standardised breed is the north African Sloughi.,The origins of the name of the breed are not clear. The Saluki has also been called the gazelle hound, Arabian hound, and the Persian greyhound. One suggested origin of the breed's name is ancient Sumerian salu-ki translating to 'plunge-earth'. However, there is no evidence a breed existed then or was referred to by the Sumerians with this name, nor is it certain what \"plunge [to/into] earth\" might have meant in reference to dogs. It is suggestive of digging for burrowing prey animals, but there is also a story (see below) of dogs being thrown toward quarry animals by a camel-mounted hunter.,The name used for the modern breed could be derived from Saluqiyyah (Arabic for \"Seleucia\", a city now in Iraq), appearing in pre-Islamic Arabic poetry. However, this is disputed.:\u200a56\u200a British diplomat Terence Clark wrote that the Arabic word saluqi indicates 'person or thing from a place named Saluq'. Arab tradition states that Saluq was an ancient town in Yemen not far from modern Ta'izz, and the Arabs associate this town with the origin of the breed. However, the word saluqi might have been derived from reference to several other places: Saluq in Armenia, and three towns called Saluqiyah. One has become modern Silifke, Turkey; another is near Antioch (modern Antakya), Turkey; and third is located near Baghdad, Iraq. Baghdad eclipsed Ctesiphon, the capital of the Persian Empire, which was located some 30 km (20 mi) to the southeast. Ctesiphon itself had replaced and absorbed Seleucia, the first capital of the Seleucid Empire (312 BC \u2013 65 AD).Regardless, the adjective saluqi may have been derived by the Arabs of the Arabian Peninsula from the similar-sounding word for Seleucid used in the Aramaic and Syriac languages spoken there by the various peoples of that part of Mesopotamia, but there is no irrefutable evidence.,Salukis are sighthounds \u2013 hunting by sight more than scent or sound \u2013 and run their quarry down to kill or retrieve it. The normal size range for the modern breed is 58\u201371 centimetres (23\u201328 in) high at the withers and 16\u201332 kilograms (35\u201370 lb) in weight. Female Salukis are slightly smaller than males. The head is long and narrow with large eyes and drop ears. The tail of the breed is long and curved. It has the typical deep-chested, long-legged body of sighthounds. The coat comes in a variety of colors including white, cream, fawn, red, grizzle/tan, black/tan, and tri-color (white, black and tan).The overall appearance of the Saluki is grace and symmetry. Two coat types \u2013 smooth and \"feathered\" \u2013 are evident in the breed's gene pool. The latter variety has light fluffing on the back of the legs, thighs, ears, and sometimes the throat. The fur on both types is silky and is low-shedding when compared to other breeds. Salukis bred in the Middle East most commonly have short hair.,There is a type called \"desert Saluki\", which descends from bloodlines brought directly from the original region of the breed. It exists in the entire Middle Eastern region. In Israel the type is known as the \"Negev Saluki\". The desert Saluki does not have influence of western lines and it tends to have a more primitive appearance. It often has a broader skull, shorter muzzle, shorter and more compact body, broader chest, less angulations, and shorter tail than the western equivalent. Some desert Salukis imported from the original region have cropped ears because this is a common tradition in countries such as Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Syria. However, it is difficult to strictly determine what desert Salukis are because even when the dogs with \"original\" bloodlines have been bred in the western world for 4 to 5 generations, many people start to call them \"western\". The type existed in the US already in the 1980s and there has been breeding in France in the 1990s. The first desert Salukis in Finland were imported from Israel in February 2000. After that, more have been imported from countries such as Syria, Oman, Qatar, Turkey. In addition to their countries of birth, they have for example Iranian, Moroccan, Bahraini, and Saudi Arabian \"Bedouin Saluki\" dogs in their background." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c534" }, "breed": "Samoyed", "origin": "Northwest Russia and Western Siberia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoyed_(dog)", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Samojed00.jpg/220px-Samojed00.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6f5" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/samoyed.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 3, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 5, "playfulness": 5, "protectiveness": 4, "trainability": 4, "energy": 4, "barking": 5, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 14, "max_height_male": 23.5, "max_height_female": 23.5, "max_weight_male": 65, "max_weight_female": 50, "min_height_male": 21, "min_height_female": 21, "min_weight_male": 45, "min_weight_female": 35, "breed": "Samoyed" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f98" }, "breed": "Samoyed", "contenido": "The Samoyed ( SAM-\u0259-yed or  s\u0259-MOY-ed; Russian: \u0421\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0435\u0301\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0301\u043a\u0430 or \u0421\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0435\u0301\u0434) is a breed of medium-sized herding dogs with thick, white, double-layer coats. They are a spitz-type dog which takes its name from the Samoyedic peoples of Siberia. Descending from the Nenets Herding Laika, they are a domesticated animal that assists in herding, hunting, protection and sled-pulling. ,Samoyed dogs are most often white, and can have a brown tint to their double-layer coat which is naturally dirt repellent. They are known to be used in expeditions in both Arctic and Antarctic regions and have a friendly and agreeable disposition. ,The progenitor of the Samoyeds was the Nenets Herding Laika, a reindeer herding spitz commonly used throughout northern Siberia, especially the Nenets people who were pejoratively referred to as Samoyeds at that time. DNA evidence confirms that Samoyeds are a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century. A genomic study of two dog specimens that are nearly 100 years old and obtained from the Nenets people on the Yamal Peninsula found that these are related to two specimens dated 2,000 years old and 850 years old, which suggests continuity of the lineage in this region. The two 100 year old dogs were closely related with the Samoyed breed, which indicates that the ancient arctic lineage lives on in the modern Samoyed dog.,During preparation for the Fram expedition to the North Pole in 1893-1896, 33 dogs were purchased from the Nenets people.  While 28 of these dogs would go to the North Pole, none of them survived. The remaining dogs, including pups born during the voyage, were left aboard the ship. In April of 1893 the bitch had another litter, most of them white. According to Nansen\u2019s notes \u201c...all the dogs were strong, tough and excellent at pulling sleds; they worked very well in hunting Polar bears [as well].\"  These dogs would become the original Samoyeds.,The AKC Standard requires 45\u201365 pounds (20\u201329 kg) and 21\u201323.5 inches (53\u201360 cm) at the shoulder for males, and 35\u201350 pounds (16\u201323 kg) and 19\u201321 inches (48\u201353 cm)  for females. The UK Kennel Club Standard requires 51\u201356 centimetres (20\u201322 in) for males, and 46\u201351 centimetres (18\u201320 in) for females.,Samoyed eyes are usually black or brown and are almond in shape.

It has gained a recognition of the Alianza Canina Latina.The breed, which is indigenous to the island, was founded with approximately 170 specimens gathered from rural parts of inner Sardinia. The breed is, therefore, a landrace. Because of the large number of founders and the breed's genetic variability, the breed should enjoy relative freedom from genetic inbreeding. Most of the dog breeds are derived by a very small number of founders (for example, nine dogs were used as founders of the Siberian Husky) and therefore inbreeding tends to be high, resulting in a high incidence of illness due to gene mutations.,The dog has a rough coat, which can be grey, black, brindle, brown or white. Height at the withers is about 56 to 60 cm for males, while females are a couple of centimeters shorter. A typical characteristic of the breed is the fiery expression of the eyes, whose position, unlike other dog breeds, is totally frontal, giving the dog a unique \"monkey-like\" appearance.Variability observed between individuals is likely due to the lack of selective pressures. There are, however, consistently strong commonalities across dogs from different locations, including characteristics such as amber eye color and the characteristic \"monkey-like face\". The coat, irrespective of color, has a typical coarse outer layer, as well as a woolly and dense undercoat. The hair on the head and hindquarters is typically short, while the face has longer furnishings around the eyes and a beard-like length around the muzzle and chin. Male dogs have a longer and thicker coat around the neck forming a mane.Approximately 15% of individuals are short-coated, and this is generally selected against in favor of the long-coated variety. Approximately 30% of individuals have a natural bobtail.,In 2016, a genomic study revealed that Fonni's Dog is associated with sighthound and molossoid breeds from the eastern and southern Mediterranean.

(\"does\" is a local dialect meaning \"swamp\" see e.g. the town of Doesburg) The dogs there had many names, and were not a specific breed as we use the term today. They were the local working dog, adapted to the people, environment, and types of work needed. They were exhibited in early dog shows (in the 1870s) as Domestic herding dog.,The dogs became nearly extinct during World War II, and the modern day breed descends from the few survivors. The Dutch Raad van Beheer (national kennel club) first recognised the breed in 1952, and the first standard was written in 1954. Related breeds are the Bearded Collie, the Puli, the Polish Lowland Sheepdog (Owczarek Nizinny), the Old English Sheepdog, the Briard, the Bergamasco Shepherd (Cane da pastore Bergamasco) and the Old German Sheepdog (Schafspudel), all of which are small versions of the \"mountain type\" herding and livestock guardian dogs.The breed was recognised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 1971, as breed number 313 in Group 1, Section 1: Sheepdogs. Exported to the North America, the breed is recognised by the Canadian Kennel Club (as Dutch Sheepdog) and the United Kennel Club (USA) in their respective Herding groups. The American Kennel Club has listed the Schapendoes as part of its Foundation Stock Service, the first step in breed recognition.

Initially one of the highland breeds of terrier that were grouped under the name of Skye Terrier, it is one of five breeds of terrier that originated in Scotland, the other four being the modern Skye, Cairn, Dandie Dinmont, and West Highland White Terriers. They are an independent and rugged breed with a wiry outer coat and a soft dense undercoat. The First Earl of Dumbarton nicknamed the breed \"the diehard\". According to legend, the Earl of Dumbarton gave this nickname because of the Scottish Terriers' bravery, and Scotties were also the inspiration for the name of his regiment, The Royal Scots, Dumbarton\u2019s Diehard.  Scottish Terriers, also known as Scotties, were originally bred to hunt vermin on farms.,They are a small breed of terrier with a distinctive shape and have had many roles in popular culture. They have been owned by a variety of celebrities, including the 32nd president of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose Scottie Fala is included with FDR in a statue in Washington, D.C., as well as by the 43rd president, George W. Bush.  They are also well known for being a playing piece in the board game Monopoly. Described as territorial, feisty dogs, they can make a good watchdog and tend to be very loyal to their family. Healthwise, Scottish Terriers can be more prone to bleeding disorders, joint disorders, autoimmune diseases, allergies, and cancer than some other breeds of dog, and there is a condition named after the breed called Scotty cramp. They are also one of the more successful dog breeds at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show with a best in show in 2010.,The Scottish Terrier is a small, compact, short-legged, sturdily-built terrier of good bone and substance. They have a hard, wiry, weather-resistant coat and a thick-set, cobby body which is hung between short, heavy legs. These characteristics, joined with their very special keen, piercing, \"varminty\" expression, and their erect ears and tail are salient features of the breed. According to The Scottish Terrier Club of America's Breed Standard, the eyes should be small, bright and piercing, and almond-shaped not round. Their color can range from black, greyish-black, and even white. The ears should be small, prick, set well up on the skull and pointed, but never cut. They should be covered with short velvety hair.According to the STCA Breed Standard, height at withers for both genders should be roughly 25 cm (9.8 in), and the length of back from withers to tail is roughly 28 cm (11 in). Generally a well-balanced Scottie dog should weigh from 8.5 to 10 kg (19 to 22 lb) and a female from 8 to 9.5 kg (18 to 21 lb). It is about 10 to 11 inches (25 to 28 cm) in height.,The Scottish Terrier typically has a hard, wiry outer coat with a soft, dense undercoat. According to the STCA Breed Standard, the coat should be trimmed and blended into the furnishings to give a distinct Scottish Terrier outline. The longer coat on the beard, legs and lower body may be slightly softer than the body coat but should not be or appear fluffy. This longer coat on the legs is often referred to as the skirt of the Scottie and should be brushed daily to avoid knotted or matted fur.,The coat colours range from dark gray to jet black and brindle, a mix of black and brown. Scotties with wheaten (straw to nearly white) coats sometimes occur, and are similar in appearance to the Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier or West Highland White Terrier." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c53e" }, "breed": "Sealyham Terrier", "origin": "Wales", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealyham_Terrier", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0a/Charmin_crufts_2009.jpg/220px-Charmin_crufts_2009.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6f9" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/sealyham_terrier.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 3, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 4, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 5, "trainability": 4, "energy": 3, "barking": 4, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 14, "max_height_male": 10.5, "max_height_female": 10.5, "max_weight_male": 24, "max_weight_female": 22, "min_height_male": 10.5, "min_height_female": 10.5, "min_weight_male": 23, "min_weight_female": 20, "breed": "Sealyham Terrier" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fa3" }, "breed": "Sealyham Terrier", "contenido": "The Sealyham Terrier (Welsh: Daeargi Sealyham) is a rare Welsh breed of small to medium-sized terrier that originated in Wales as a working dog.  It is principally a white-bodied, rough-coated breed, developed in the mid-to-late-19th century by Captain John Edwardes at Sealyham House, Pembrokeshire.,Following the First World War, it surged in popularity and was associated with Hollywood stars and members of the British Royal Family. Its numbers have dropped significantly since then, with the breed listed as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club; an all-time low was recorded in 2008 when only 43 puppies were registered in the United Kingdom. This decline has been blamed on an influx of foreign and designer breeds, and the Sealyham's reduced usefulness as a working dog.,This breed is equally suitable as a family dog or a working terrier, given the right training. It is affected by few breed specific breed disorders, with the only two prevalent conditions being lens luxation and canine degenerative myelopathy.  A DNA test is now readily available to identify dogs who carry the gene that causes lens luxation and breeding programs can be adjusted.,The breed was developed between 1850 and 1891 by Captain John Edwardes, at Sealyham House, near Wolfscastle in the Welsh county of Pembrokeshire. Originally the breed was used for pest control, to hunt small game, and to eliminate vermin,  particularly badgers, which he usually relocated. The Welsh Corgi, Fox Terrier (Wire), and the now extinct English White Terrier all played a part in the make up of the Sealyham, although Edwardes did not keep records. He wanted a small white dog with a strong jaw, and a wiry coat. The white coat was particularly prized, as it meant that the hunter in the field could distinguish the dogs from the quarry. Edwardes culled weak dogs, and bred the stronger ones. After Edwardes' death in 1891, other breeders began to work with Sealyhams, including Fred Lewis, who promoted the breed.,The breed was shown for the first time in 1903, and the Sealyham Terrier club was created in 1908; the breed was officially recognised by the Kennel Club in 1911. The Sealyham Terrier now is recognised by all of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world. During the early stages of its recognition, the breed was alternatively known as the Welsh Border Terrier, or the Cowley Terrier. The American Sealyham Terrier Club was founded in 1913.During the 1920s and 1930s, Sir Jocelyn Lucas used the dogs to hunt badgers which he usually relocated. At this time he also used Sealyham Terriers for hunting otters, stoats and squirrels. Deciding that he wanted a better hunting dog than the Sealyhams, bred for conformation showing, he cross-bred the dogs with the Norfolk Terrier. This resulted in an unrecognised breed of dog he called the Lucas Terrier, which he described as \"death to rats and rabbits\".The Sealyham surged in popularity after the First World War in the UK and the United States. Within the Hollywood film industry, the Sealyham became a fashionable dog to own by the Hollywood elite. The terrier was owned by actors Tallulah Bankhead, Humphrey Bogart, Bette Davis, Elizabeth Taylor, and by writer Agatha Christie. Cary Grant owned one which he named Archie Leach \u2013 Grant's real name. Alfred Hitchcock had one of his Sealyham Terriers seen in his 1941 film Suspicion. Alfred Hitchcock can also be seen at the start of his 1963 film, The Birds, walking two of his Sealyham Terriers in a cameo appearance, although he also owned a third Sealyham not featured in the movie. The British Royal Family also favoured these dogs; King George V owned a dog named Jack. In 1959 one Sunday newspaper reported in the UK: \"A notice has been posted in Clarence House and Windsor Castle giving explicit instructions that when Princess Margaret has breakfast in bed, her two Sealyhams must be brought to the room along with her breakfast tray.\" These two dogs were called Pippin and Johnny, and were looked after by the Queen Mother when Princess Margaret fell ill. In the 1960s, children's author Maurice Sendak owned a Sealyham named Jennie, which he featured in his 1967 work Higglety Pigglety Pop!.,The Sealyham was once one of the more popular terriers, and one of the best known Welsh breeds. Today, however, the Kennel Club (UK) lists the Sealyham as amongst the most endangered native breeds. In 2008, registrations of new puppies with the Kennel Club dropped to an all-time low of 43, placing it among the bottom three on the list of Vulnerable Native Breeds. In October 2011, British magazine Country Life highlighted the breed on its front cover, with the heading \"SOS: Save our Sealyhams\", and launched a campaign to save the breed. End of year figures for 2011 showed that 49 puppies were registered with the Kennel Club in the UK, keeping them within the bottom three on the list of most endangered breeds.Another notable Sealyham Terrier, Ch. Efbe's Hidalgo At Goodspice, also known as Charmin, won Best In Show at Crufts in 2009, but his victory was not televised as the BBC had dropped the coverage of the competition earlier that year, following the controversy after the channel showed the documentary Pedigree Dogs Exposed. He had previous won the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in the United States in 2007, and the World Dog Show in 2008. While in retirement, Charmin attended many shows as a spectator until he died in October, 2018.,Sealyham terriers have also been featured on social media channels, contributing to a gain in notoriety of this rare breed. On Facebook, Ivor the Sealyham terrier (2007-2020) posted weekly photos, updates and videos of his walks in Wales, gaining over 20,000 fans worldwide.Harry Parsons, founder of the Working Sealyham Terrier Club, has stated that, \"To sustain a breed...you need between 300 to 500 puppies a year\". The Kennel Club has blamed the decline of the breed on the availability of designer dogs and newer breeds such as the Shih Tzu, and the banning of tail docking which has reduced their ability as working dogs. Paul Keevil, formerly of the Kennel Club's vulnerable breeds committee explains: \"Traditionally, soon after Sealyhams were born, their tails were docked by half their length, because they were small working dogs and they quite often got stuck down holes, meaning that they required short, strong tails for the owner to be able to pull them out.\" As of 2010, the breed is ranked 152nd out of 168 breeds according to registrations by the American Kennel Club.  By 2017, the breed ranked 150 out of 190 breeds registered by the American Kennel Club." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c541" }, "breed": "Serbian Tricolour Hound", "origin": "Serbia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_Tricolour_Hound", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Srpski_Trobojni_Gonic.gif/220px-Srpski_Trobojni_Gonic.gif", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fa8" }, "breed": "Serbian Tricolour Hound", "contenido": "The Serbian Tricolour Hound (Serbo-Croatian: srpski trobojni goni\u010d / \u0441\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0458\u043d\u0438 \u0433\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0447), formerly called the Yugoslavian Tricolour Hound (Serbo-Croatian: jugoslovenski trobojni goni\u010d / \u0458\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0458\u043d\u0438 \u0433\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0447), is a breed of scent hound from Serbia. ,The Serbian Tricolour Hound, like the closely related Serbian Hound, Montenegrin Mountain Hound, Posavac Hound, Istrian Shorthaired Hound, Istrian Coarse-haired Hound and Barak Hound, is believed to have descended from hounds traded by Mediterranean seafarers through ports on the Adriatic coast. All scent hounds, these breeds are believed to also have some early sighthound blood in their ancestry.According to Serbia's national kennel club the Kinolo\u0161ki Savez Srbije, the Serbian Tricolour Hound was initially considered a variety of the Serbian Hound, but in 1946 a separate breed standard was drawn up and it was granted separate recognition. The breed was recognised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 1961. Originally called the Yugoslavian Tricolour Hound, the breed's name was changed after the breakup of SFR Yugoslavia.,Rarely seen outside of its homeland, the Serbian Tricolour Hound is considered extremely rare and at possible risk of extinction.,The Serbian Tricolour Hound is a moderately sized scent hound that is very similar to the black and tan coloured Montenegrin Mountain Hound, but typically is slightly lighter in build. According to the Kinolo\u0161ki Savez Srbije's breed standard, dogs typically stand between 45 and 55 centimetres (18 and 22 in) with an ideal height of 51 centimetres (20 in), whilst bitches are slightly shorter standing between 44 and 54 centimetres (17 and 21 in) with an ideal height of 49 centimetres (19 in). Healthy adult Serbian Hounds typically weigh between 20 and 25 kilograms (44 and 55 lb). Their bodies are slightly longer than they are tall, they have long legs and good bone.The breed's coat is short, thick, glossy and course to touch, it provides the breed with good protection from the elements; in colour they are predominantly black and fawn with a white around the neck, on the chest on their extremities and a blaze on the face." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c544" }, "breed": "Shetland Sheepdog", "origin": "Scotland", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shetland_Sheepdog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Shetland_Sheepdog_600.jpg/220px-Shetland_Sheepdog_600.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6fb" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/shetland_sheepdog.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 5, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 3, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 2, "playfulness": 5, "protectiveness": 5, "trainability": 5, "energy": 4, "barking": 5, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 14, "max_height_male": 16, "max_height_female": 16, "max_weight_male": 25, "max_weight_female": 25, "min_height_male": 13, "min_height_female": 13, "min_weight_male": 15, "min_weight_female": 15, "breed": "Shetland Sheepdog" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fab" }, "breed": "Shetland Sheepdog", "contenido": "The Shetland Sheepdog, often known as the Sheltie, is a breed of herding dog that originated in the Shetland Islands of Scotland. The original name was Shetland Collie, but this caused controversy amongst Rough Collie breeders of the time, so the breed's name was formally changed. This diligent small dog is clever, vocal, excitable and willing to please. They are incredibly trustworthy to their owners to the point where they are often referred to as \"shadows\" due to their attachment to family. This breed was formally recognized by The Kennel Club (UK) in 1909.,Like the Shetland pony, Shetland cattle and the Shetland sheep, the Shetland Sheepdog is a hardy but diminutive breed developed to thrive amidst the harsh and meagre conditions of its native islands.  While the Sheltie still excels at herding, today it is often raised as a working dog and/or family pet.The Sheltie's origins are obscure, but it is not a direct descendant of the Rough Collie, which it largely resembles. Rather, the Sheltie is a descendant of small specimens of the Scottish Collie and the King Charles Spaniel. They were originally a small mixed-breed dog, often only about 20 to 30 centimetres (8 to 12 inches) in height at the shoulder, and it is thought that the original Shetland herding dogs were of the Spitz type, and were crossed with Collies from mainland Britain. In the early 20th century, James Loggie added a small Rough Collie to the breeding stock, and helped establish the breed that would become the modern Shetland Sheepdog.,Unlike many miniature breeds that resemble their larger counterparts, this breed was not developed simply by selectively breeding the Rough Collie for smaller and smaller size. The original sheepdog of Shetland was a Spitz-type dog, probably similar to the modern Icelandic Sheepdog. This dog was crossed with mainland working collies brought to the islands, and then after being brought to England, it was further extensively crossed with the Rough Collie, and other breeds including some or all of the extinct Greenland Yakki, the King Charles Spaniel (not the Cavalier), the Pomeranian,  and possibly the Border Collie.  The original Spitz-type working sheepdog of Shetland is now extinct, having been replaced for herding there by the Border Collie. Shelties were used for herding until commercial livestock farming required larger breeds.When the breed was originally introduced breeders called them Shetland Collies, which upset Rough Collie breeders, so the name was changed to Shetland Sheepdog. During the early 20th century (up until the 1940s), additional crosses were made to Rough Collies to help retain the desired Rough Collie type \u2013 in fact, the first English Sheltie champion's dam, Gesta, was a rough Collie.,The year 1909 marked the initial recognition of the Sheltie by the English Kennel Club, with the first registered Sheltie being a female called Badenock Rose.  The first Sheltie to be registered by the American Kennel Club was \"Lord Scott\" in 1911.,The general appearance of the Sheltie is that of a miniature Rough Collie. They are a small, double coated, working dog, agile and sturdy. Blue merle Shelties may have blue eyes or one brown and one blue eye, but all others have dark-colored eyes. Their expression should be that of alertness with a gentle and sometimes reserved nature. They are often very good with children. They carry their tail down low, only lifted when alert and never carried over the back. They are an intensely loyal breed, sometimes reserved with strangers but should not be shy or showing timidness as per the AKC breed standard." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c545" }, "breed": "Shiba Inu", "origin": "Japan", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiba_Inu", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Shiba_Inu_%28Chinese_characters%29.svg/70px-Shiba_Inu_%28Chinese_characters%29.svg.png", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6fc" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/shiba_inu.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 5, "trainability": 2, "energy": 3, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 13, "max_life_expectancy": 16, "max_height_male": 16.5, "max_height_female": 16.5, "max_weight_male": 23, "max_weight_female": 17, "min_height_male": 14.5, "min_height_female": 14.5, "min_weight_male": 23, "min_weight_female": 17, "breed": "Shiba Inu" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fac" }, "breed": "Shiba Inu", "contenido": "The Shiba Inu (\u67f4\u72ac, Japanese: [\u0255iba in\u026f]) is a breed of hunting dog from Japan. A small-to-medium breed, it is the smallest of the six original and distinct spitz breeds of dog native to Japan.A small, alert, and agile dog that copes very well with mountainous terrain and hiking trails, the Shiba Inu was originally bred for hunting. It looks similar to and is often mistaken for other Japanese dog breeds such as the Akita Inu or Hokkaido, but the Shiba Inu is a different breed with a distinct blood line, temperament, and smaller size than other Japanese dog breeds.,The Shiba's frame is compact with well-developed muscles.The Shiba Inu is double coated, with the outer coat being stiff and straight and the undercoat soft and thick. Fur is short and even on the fox-like face, ears, and legs. Guard hairs stand off the body and are about 4 to 5 cm (1+1\u20442 to 2 in) long at the withers. The purpose of the guard hairs is to protect their underlying skin and to repel rain or snow. Tail hair is slightly longer and stands open in a brush. Their tails are a defining characteristic and makes them stand apart from other dog breeds. Their tails help to protect them from the harsh winter weather. When they sleep, Shiba Inus curl up and use their tails to shield their face and nose in order to protect their sensitive areas from the cold. The cream color is considered a \"major fault\" by both the Japan Kennel Club and American Kennel Club. It should never be intentionally bred in a show dog, as the required markings known as \"urajiro\" (\u88cf\u767d) are not visible; \"Urajiro\" literally translates to \"underside white\". Conversely, a white (cream) coat is perfectly acceptable according to the British Kennel Club breed standard.The urajiro (cream to white ventral color) is required in the following areas on all coat colors: on the sides of the muzzle, on the cheeks, inside the ears, on the underjaw and upper throat inside of legs, on the abdomen, around the vent and the ventral side of the tail. On reds: commonly on the throat, forechest, and chest. On blacks and sesames: commonly as a triangular mark on both sides of the forechest.,Shibas tend to exhibit an independent nature.

Shih Tzus are well-known for their short snout and large round eyes, as well as their ever growing coat, floppy ears, and short and stout posture. Although small in size, they are well-known for their largely fun and playful personality, and calm and friendly temperament. They are able to adapt well in different situations. Due to their highly independent nature, they are not considered the most obedient breed.,The Shih Tzu is a sturdy little dog with a small muzzle and normally has large dark brown eyes. The Chinese have described their head shapes as \"owl head\" and \"lion head\", and their mouth as \"frog mouth\". They have a soft and long double coat that will tangle and mat easily if not brushed at least every 2 or 3 days. A Shih Tzu should stand no more than 26.7 cm (10\u00bd\") at the withers and with an ideal weight of 4.0 to 7.5 kg (9 to 17 lb).  Floppy ears are covered with long fur, and the heavily furred tail is carried curled over the back. The coat may be of any color, though white and with blazes of grey are frequently seen. A very noticeable feature is the underbite, which is required in the breed standard.The traditional long silky coat, which tends to reach the floor, requires daily brushing to avoid tangles. Because of their long coat and fast-growing hair, regular grooming is necessary and important, which may be expensive and should be taken into account when considering adopting one of this breed. Often, the coat is clipped short to simplify care, but the coat still requires daily brushing. For conformation showing, the coat must be left in its natural state, though trimming for neatness around the feet and anus is allowed. The shorter cut is typically called a \"puppy cut\" or a \"teddy bear cut\" when the puppy cut is accompanied by a fuller, rounder face, resembling a cute and cuddly stuffed animal.,The name comes from the Chinese language word for \"lion\" because this kind of dog was bred to resemble \"the lion, as  in traditional oriental art\". (The Pekingese breed is also called \u7345\u5b50\u72d7 \"lion dog\" in Chinese.) \"Shih Tzu\" is the Wade-Giles romanization of the Chinese characters \u7345\u5b50 \"lion\". ,In contemporary mandarin, the Shih Tzu is generally known as the \"Xi Shi dog\"; Xi Shi was regarded as one of the most beautiful women of ancient China. Shih Tzu were nicknamed the Chrysanthemum Dog in England in the 1930s. The dog may also be called the Tibetan Lion Dog, but whether the breed should be referred to as \"Tibetan\" or \"Chinese\" is a source of both historical and political contention, as the subsequent section notes. A book on the breed states that \"dog historians tend to have very strong opinions\" on the subject." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c549" }, "breed": "Silken Windhound", "origin": "United States", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silken_Windhound", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Fallon_the_Silken_Windhound.jpg/220px-Fallon_the_Silken_Windhound.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fb1" }, "breed": "Silken Windhound", "contenido": "The Silken Windhound is an American breed of sighthound.

It originates from North Africa and is found in Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco and Libya.,The Sloughi has existed for centuries in North Africa, primarily from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia but also into parts of Libya and Egypt.  The name \u2018sloughi\u201d is the same combination of letters in Arabic as Saluki, and the two breeds likely share a common ancestor.  Neolithic rock paintings in Algeria and tomb paintings in Egypt have been found which show distinctly slender dogs with drop ears.  Sloughis are still used for hunting in its native countries, and also is a reliable guard dog.   The Sloughi was accepted into the FCI in 1998 and received full recognition by the American Kennel Club as of January 1, 2016 when it became eligible to compete in the AKC Hound Group.,The sloughi should not to be confused with the smooth Saluki, nor to be confused with the smooth Afghan Hound. The Sloughi is a medium-large, short-haired, smooth-coated, athletic sighthound developed by the Berbers in North Africa (in the area including Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya) to hunt game such as hare, fox, jackal, gazelle, and wild pigs. It is an ancient breed, treasured in North Africa for its hunting skills, speed, agility, and endurance over long distances. It is a robust, but elegant and racy, pursuit dog with no exaggeration of length of body or limbs, muscle development, angulation, nor curve of loin. The Sloughi is not a fragile dog, but is also a dog with class and grace. The attitude is noble and somewhat aloof, and the expression of the dark eyes is gentle and melancholy. In regions where they are still used as sight hounds, their appearance can vary from region to region to best suit the terrain and the game animal.The Sloughi's head is long and elegant with drop ears. The body and legs show defined bony structure and strong, lean muscles. The skeletal structure is sturdy. The topline is essentially horizontal blending into a bony, gently sloping croup. The tail is long and carried low with an upward curve at the end.,The Sloughi is a primitive hunting breed that bonds extremely closely with its owner or family from an early age. They are unlikely to be exceedingly shy or aggressive. A well bred and well socialized Sloughi is a stable, attentive, and exceedingly loving family member.The American Sloughi Association standard states that, \u201cThe Sloughi is a dog with class and grace. The attitude is noble and somewhat aloof.\u201dBecause of their origins as the hunters and guardians of Sahara nomads and bedouins, the Sloughi is reserved with strangers and takes a while to warm up to new friends. The Sloughi also expects reserve from people they meet, and may not appreciate those who are too familiar. The Sloughi is also noted for its primitive instincts, for unlike other sighthound breeds it is highly alert and territorial which made them prized by the Berbers, not only as hunters, but as fearless watch dogs.Improperly socialized Sloughis can be shy and or aggressive towards other dogs, and it is critical that breeders consider temperament in their breeding decisions and that puppies receive appropriate socialization from an early age so that they mature into well adjusted adults. Their socialization must include not only new people, but new situations, environments and other dogs.Sloughis that are accustomed to children are excellent with children. As with all breeds, children need to be taught to respect dogs and not to mistreat them." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c553" }, "breed": "Smooth Collie", "origin": "Scotland", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_Collie", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/SmoothCollieTri2_wb.jpg/220px-SmoothCollieTri2_wb.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fbd" }, "breed": "Smooth Collie", "contenido": "The Smooth Collie is a breed of dog developed originally for herding.

Some breed organisations consider the smooth-coat and rough-coat dogs to be variations of the same breed.,The early history of the Smooth Collie, like that of many dog breeds, is largely a matter of speculation. Even the origin of the breed's name is unclear, variously claimed to describe the early shepherd dog's dark colour (\"coaly\"), or derived from the name of a breed of sheep with black faces once commonly kept in Scotland (\"Colley\"), or derived from an Anglo-Saxon word meaning \"useful.\" The word could also trace to Gaelic or/and Irish - in which the words for \"doggie\" are, respectively, c\u00e0ilean and coile\u00e1n. This would be more consistent with the breed's origin in the Gaelic-speaking Scottish Highlands than an Anglo-Saxon term.,The modern history of both the Smooth and Rough Collie began in the reign of Queen Victoria, who became interested in the shepherds' dogs while at Balmoral Castle in Scotland. In 1860, she purchased some of the dogs for her own kennel. With the Queen's interest, it became fashionable to own Smooth Collies. Thus began the breed's transformation from working farm dog, similar to the modern Border collie, to the dog bred as a pet and for the sport of conformation showing that we know today.,The Smooth Collie today is considered a variety of the same breed as the Rough Collie in the United States, Canada, meaning that they can interbreed and some statistics are kept only for \"Collie\" rather than for both varieties individually. The smooth and rough are classified as separate breeds in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, and Australia. The latter is a fairly recent development, however, with the Kennel Club (UK) allowing the interbreeding of the two varieties until 1993." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c556" }, "breed": "Spanish Mastiff", "origin": "Spain", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Mastiff", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Spanish_Mastiff.JPG/220px-Spanish_Mastiff.JPG", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c705" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/spanish_mastiff.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 1, "drooling": 5, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 2, "protectiveness": 5, "trainability": 3, "energy": 3, "barking": 1, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 12, "max_height_male": 35, "max_height_female": 35, "max_weight_male": 200, "max_weight_female": 200, "min_height_male": 28, "min_height_female": 28, "min_weight_male": 140, "min_weight_female": 140, "breed": "Spanish Mastiff" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fc2" }, "breed": "Spanish Mastiff", "contenido": "The Spanish Mastiff or Mast\u00edn Espa\u00f1ol is a breed of dog from Spain, originally bred to be a guard dog and whose specialized purpose is to be a livestock guardian dog protecting flocks and/or herds from wolves and other predators.,In medieval times, this dog has accompanied the herds of sheep crossing from northern to southern Spain, defending cattle from attack by wolves and other predators.

It is a low, compact spaniel and is as old a breed as and similar in appearance to the Clumber Spaniel. They can be slow-paced, but can have a clownish and energetic temperament. They suffer from health conditions common to spaniels and some large dogs, as well as a specific range of heart conditions and spinal disc herniation.,The Sussex Spaniel was first recorded in 1795 in East and West Sussex, being at Goodwood and Rolvenden for specific hunting conditions. The breed nearly became extinct during the Second World War, but was bred back to sustainable numbers. It is now more popular in the United Kingdom and the United States than any other countries, and is recognised by all major kennel clubs. The breed was one of the first to be recognised by the UK Kennel Club in 1872. Sussex Spaniel Stump won the best in show in 2009 at the 133rd Westminster Kennel Club.,The Sussex Spaniel is a low compact spaniel similar in appearance, but not in colour, to a  Clumber Spaniel. It is normally no taller than 15\u201316 in (38\u201341 cm) at the withers and the usual weight range is 45\u201350 lb (20\u201323 kg) with a roughly rectangular appearance. The Clumber Spaniel meanwhile is normally between 17\u201320 in (43\u201351 cm) high at the shoulder, and weighing 55\u201385 lb (25\u201339 kg).One of the noticeable features is their golden liver-coloured coat which is unique to the breed. Historically however, there have also been examples of black, black and tan and golden liver and white coloured Sussex Spaniels.  coat is thick (sometimes with a slight wave to it), feathering on the chest, legs and ears and consists of a weather-resistant undercoat with a silky outer coat. The eyes are hazel in colour. The long silky ears are lobe-shaped typical of the Spaniel, and set moderately low. The Sussex is a short, stocky kind of dog.,The Sussex Spaniel is a slow-paced, calm breed with somewhat clownish behaviour that normally keeps his energy and enthusiasm in check.  He is always eager to be around people, is excellent around children, and can be quite protective of the family. They make excellent candidates for therapy dog work.  Most Sussex Spaniels are primarily family pets, but they are competent enough to aid a hunter though quite stubborn to train. They tend to have a natural ability to quarter in the field, have excellent noses, and can be used to retrieve, given training. The breed is the only spaniel to howl once a game's scent is picked up.,The South Russian Ovcharka or South Russian Shepherd Dog is breed of flock guardian dog developed in the Russian Empire and in the Soviet Union. It is thought to derive from cross-breeding between local dogs of the Russian steppes and long-haired shepherd dogs brought to the area from Spain with Merino sheep. These may have been similar in appearance to the present-day Gos d'Atura Catala.,The South Russian Ovcharka is thought to derive from cross-breeding between local dogs of the Russian steppes and long-haired shepherd dogs brought to the area from Spain with Merino sheep. These may have been similar in appearance to the present-day Gos d'Atura Catala. A cross-bred dog of this type won a gold medal at the Exposition Universelle of 1867 in Paris.Much of the selective breeding and development of the breed took place in the early twentieth century, on the estates of Friedrich von Falz-Fein at Askania-Nova, now in Kherson Oblast, Ukraine. The breed standard was approved early in the 1930s.The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale definitively accepted it on 30 September 1983 as the Yuzhnorusskaya Ovcharka or South Russian Shepherd Dog.,It is a large dog: dogs stand no less that 66 cm at the withers and weigh at least 35 kg; bitches are about 4 cm smaller and weigh some 5 kg less. The head is long and of wedge shape; the ears are pendent and triangular. The coat is long, coarse and thick. It may be solid white, grey or pale ivory; or white with  tinges of yellow, or white with patches of grey, pale ivory or wheat colour.,The dog is banned in Denmark." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c561" }, "breed": "Swedish Lapphund", "origin": "Sweden", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Lapphund", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Svensk_lapphund.JPG/220px-Svensk_lapphund.JPG", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c70c" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/swedish_lapphund.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 4, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 4, "trainability": 5, "energy": 4, "barking": 4, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 14, "max_height_male": 20, "max_height_female": 20, "max_weight_male": 45, "max_weight_female": 45, "min_height_male": 16, "min_height_female": 16, "min_weight_male": 30, "min_weight_female": 30, "breed": "Swedish Lapphund" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fcd" }, "breed": "Swedish Lapphund", "contenido": "The Swedish Lapphund (Swedish: Svensk lapphund) is a breed of dog of the Spitz type from Sweden, one of three Lapphund breeds developed from a type of dog used by the Sami people for herding and guarding their reindeer.,The expression \"the black beauty of Norrland\" is very often attributed to the Swedish lapphund, which is most likely one of Sweden's oldest breeds.,The breed falls under the mitochondrial DNA sub-clade referred to as d1 that is only found in northern Scandinavia.

Subclade d1 originated 480\u20133,000 years ago and is found in all Sami-related breeds: Finnish Lapphund, Swedish Lapphund, Lapponian Herder, Jamthund, Norwegian Elkhound and H\u00e4llefors Elkhound.

As a working dog they show their versatility in a number of different fields.,Many compete with success in such widely different disciplines as obedience,,dog agility trials, working contest, freestyle/heelwork to music, Rally obedience, and blood,tracking.

In 1942, the dog came close to extinction, but careful breeding and publicity by Swedish national Bjorn von Rosen and K. G. Zettersten managed to revive the breed in popularity and save it from its likely end. In 1943, the Swedish Kennel Club recognized the Swedish Vallhund as a breed, and officially categorized the Swedish Vallhund as \"the V\u00e4stg\u00f6taspets\" for V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland, the province in which their revival took place. Since then, the breed has been recognized by, and bred in, over ten countries and has gained some popularity.,The average height of the Swedish Vallhund, measured at the withers, is approximately 33 cm (12.9 in) for males and 31 cm (12.2 in) for females. They are strong, with a long body. The ratio of height to body length is about 2:3. The head of the Vallhund is wedge-shaped, with dark brown oval eyes and pricked ears. They are born with every variance of tail length, from no tail at all to full length, therefore they are often mistaken for having been docked. (Tail docking is illegal in Sweden.),The coat is short and harsh, with a tight topcoat and a soft, dense undercoat. The hair on the foreparts of the legs is slightly longer than that of the neck, chest and back parts of the hind legs. Fur color varies from grey, greyish brown and greyish yellow to reddish brown, with darker hair on the back, neck, and sides of the body. Lighter hair in the same shade of color as mentioned above can be seen on the muzzle, throat, chest, belly, buttocks, feet and hocks. They have lighter markings on their shoulders, also known as harness markings. Some dogs have white patches which appear, to a small extent, as a narrow blaze, neckstop or slight necklace, as well as having white markings on their fore and hindlegs and on the chest. The maximum is 30% white.,The Swedish Vallhund is generally a healthy dog. Its small stature contributes to its longevity, with an average lifespan of 15 years. Its pointy ears mean that\u2014unlike dog breeds with long, hanging ears\u2014ear problems are rare. This breed does well in hot climates because of its double layer coat, as long as the dog is provided cool shade and water. The breed does not do well in very deep snow because of its short legs. The Vallhund has an inherited type of progressive retinal atrophy disease in 34.9% of the population, which appears as mild to moderate night-blindness around the age of ten." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c563" }, "breed": "Taigan", "origin": "Kyrgyzstan", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taigan", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Taigan.jpg/220px-Taigan.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fd2" }, "breed": "Taigan", "contenido": "The Taigan (Kyrgyz: \u0442\u0430\u0439\u0433\u0430\u043d), and also known as Kyrgyz Taighany (Kyrgyz: \u043a\u044b\u0440\u0433\u044b\u0437 \u0442\u0430\u0439\u0433\u0430\u043d\u044b) (Kyrgyzskaya Borzaya in Russian), is a breed of sighthound from Kyrgyzstan.

The Thai Ridgeback is one of only three breeds that has a ridge of hair that runs along its back in the opposite direction to the rest of the coat. The other two are the Rhodesian Ridgeback and the Phu Quoc Ridgeback.,The Thai Ridgeback is a muscular, medium-sized pariah-type dog with a wedge-shaped head, triangular-shaped prick ears, and a very short, smooth coat. It has a pronounced ridge on its back formed by hair growing in the opposite direction that extends from behind the withers to the hips. Puppies are occasionally born ridgeless. Thai Ridgebacks have a muscular and streamlined body, making them extremely agile. The tail is carried upward called a sickle or sword tail. Its forehead wrinkles with enormous expression.  Like many eastern breeds,  the Thai Ridgeback has retained a  'scissor jaw' where upper and lower teeth interlock when the jaw bones clamp down.  The tongue can be black or have black marks.  Eyes are almond-shaped and brown but may be amber in blue dogs. The ears are set low and point slightly outward. The ears stand up progressively during the puppy growth period; they are not cropped. The back is straight and level. The coat is short, hard, and straight. Due to the length and density of the coat shedding is minimal, occurring once or twice yearly. Because this breed does not have an undercoat the hair does not usually bother people allergic to other breeds of dogs. Coat must be solid colors of blue, black, red or fawn with a black mask being acceptable on reds. However, brindle and white are also found but are not acceptable colors. For international show and competition, shoulder height should be 22-24 inches (56\u201361 cm) in males and 20-22 inches (51\u201356 cm) in females. The weight averages 35\u201355 lbs in females and 40-60 lbs in males.,Eight distinctive ridge patterns have been identified: needle, feather, arrow, lute, violin, bowling pin, leaf, and saddleback. All patterns are acceptable, but must be clearly defined and symmetrical. The broader the ridge, the more highly it is prized.,Thai ridgebacks are a hearty, overall healthy breed with few inherent health issues. The breed has reproduced in Thailand almost exclusively by natural selection until the very recent past. The domesticated population is small. Inbreeding depression has not been observed in the breed. Thai Ridgeback Dogs are prone to dermoid sinus. Modern lines of Thai Ridgeback, resulting from interpopulation crosses, may also be prone to hip dysplasia and other genetic disorders.,Thai Ridgebacks are an intelligent breed. The energy level is typically medium to high, with most of the day spent lounging and activity periods occurring in sporadic bursts. Well bred and properly socialized Thai Ridgebacks make loyal, loving family pets. They are naturally protective of their home and family and can be aggressive or shy when not properly socialized. They are best kept by consistent owners who have a thorough understanding of dog behavior. Because of prior geographic isolation and lack of human contact, the Thai Ridgeback remains independent minded and much of the original natural instinct and drives remain intact, particularly prey drive. Due to its nature, the Thai Ridgeback is not recommended for the novice dog handler. They have an excellent jumping ability and may seek to roam if not properly contained." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c570" }, "breed": "Tosa", "origin": "Japan", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosa_(dog)", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/BUKADAI_2.jpg/220px-BUKADAI_2.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c714" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/tosa.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 1, "shedding": 2, "grooming": 1, "drooling": 3, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 1, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 5, "trainability": 3, "energy": 3, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 12, "max_height_male": 23.5, "max_height_female": 23.5, "max_weight_male": 200, "max_weight_female": 200, "min_height_male": 21.5, "min_height_female": 21.5, "min_weight_male": 100, "min_weight_female": 100, "breed": "Tosa" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fe3" }, "breed": "Tosa", "contenido": "The Tosa Inu (\u571f\u4f50, also called the Tosa-Ken and Japanese Mastiff) is a breed of dog of Japanese origin that is considered rare.

Ownership is restricted in some countries as a dangerous breed.,The Tosa varies considerably in size, with the Japanese-bred dogs tending to be about half the size of those bred outside the country.

These dogs were crossed with European dog breeds, such as the Old English Bulldog in 1872, English Mastiff in 1874, Saint Bernard and German Pointer in 1876, Great Dane in 1924, and Bull Terrier.[2] The aim was to breed a larger, more powerful dog specifically for dog fighting competitions in Japan. The heyday of Tosa breeding was between 1924 and 1933, when it was said that there were more than 5,000 Tosa breeders in Japan.,Ownership of Tosas is legally restricted in certain jurisdictions. In the United Kingdom ownership is regulated under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, and in Trinidad and Tobago under the Dog Control Act 2014.

Used to hunt small game, these dogs were bred from terriers and hounds. These dogs became known as the Treeing Feist; feist is a derivation of fist and is a term used in Southern America for a small fierce dog.  The word treeing refers to their hunting style of running game up into trees and indicating to the hunter which tree the game has climbed. Both the Treeing and Mountain Feist breeds are used to hunt small game, particularly squirrel and rodents, as well as raccoons, opossums, rabbits and for flushing birds.In the 20th century these dogs became increasingly rare and in the early 1980s a group of devotees banded together to prevent their extinction. In 1984 the Mountain Feist Association was formed; in 1985 this was replaced by the American Treeing Feist Association, and this was joined by the Mountain Feist Breeder's Club in 1986, the Mountain Treeing Feist Organization in 1992 and the Traditional Treeing Feist Club in 1999.

The Westphalian Dachsbracke was used in Sweden to develop the Drever.,The Westphalian Dachsbracke (Westf\u00e4lische Dachsbracke, German for Badger hound) is a small, short-legged version of the Deutsche Bracke, and very similar in size and appearance to the Drever (FCI No. 130), but 2 cm shorter (the Drever was first registered in Sweden in 1910 as the Westf\u00e4lische Dachsbracke; the name was changed in 1947.)The Westphalian Dachsbracke stands about 30 to 38 cm (12 to 15 in) high at the withers. It has medium-long drooped ears, short legs, and a long tail which is set high and carried up. The coat has short fur, usually tricolor (red to yellow with a black saddle), with white markings called Bracken marks - a white muzzle, chest, legs, collar, and tip of the tail, and a blaze on the head. The chest is more narrow than the Dachshund's chest, and the legs are longer.,The Westphalian Dachsbracke was first described as a variety of German Hound in 1886. It was recognized by the Verband f\u00fcr das Deutsche Hundewesen (German Kennel Club) in 1935 with its current name, and by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale as breed number 100 in Group 6 (scenthounds), Section 1.3 (small hounds). The Westphalian Dachsbracke is the ancestor breed of the Swedish scenthound, the Drever. Of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world, only the United Kennel Club in the US recognises the Westphalian Dachsbracke, in its scenthound group. The Westphalian Dachsbracke also may be recognised by any of the many minor registries, rare breed groups, hunting clubs, and internet dog registry businesses under its original name or variations on the name. Hunting use of the Westphalian Dachsbracke has been mostly supplanted by the Drever, and the Westphalian Dachsbracke is seldom seen even in its home country; purchasers of dogs represented as Westphalian Dachsbracke should research the dog's background, especially if it is registered with one of the minor clubs that require little to no documentation before accepting a dog or litter for registration.,Dachs is German for badger, a term used for hunting dogs with short legs. The name Dachsbracke may reflect that the Dachsbracke dogs were bred down in size by crossbreeding long-legged Bracken with the Dachshund. Historically, the term Bracke was used in German to mean the scenthounds. Brack is an old Low German word for a coastal marsh periodically inundated by storm surges with salt water (related to the English word brackish). In Europe, scenthounds are usually separated into running hounds (free running packs, which either drive the game back to the hunter, or the hunter follows as they run, or the hunter waits until the dogs' cries communicate that game has been found and held, and then goes to that spot) or leash hounds (which follow the game or track wounded or dead game while being held on a leash by the hunter.) The Bracke are usually used as running hounds, in packs, to hunt rabbits or foxes in a type of hunt called Brackade. The Dachsbracke are used for hunting today mainly in Scandinavia and in alpine regions.,The  Deutsche Bracke (German Bracke, also called the German Hound, F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale breed number 299) is another breed of Bracke, the first one registered as a separate breed, in 1900.

They all were large, short-coated dogs of varying head-types. The former two resembled the mastiff-type dogs much like the present-day Dogo Argentino or like the Caucasian Shepherd Dog except with short hair and a mesocephalic head which made them excellent large-game hunters, the gentile was a large sighthound type. The Alaunt type may have been originally bred by the Alani tribes, the nomads of Indo-European Sarmatian ancestry who spoke an Iranian language. The Alans were known as superb warriors, herdsmen, and breeders of horses and dogs. The Alans bred their dogs for work and developed different strains within the breed for specific duties. The type was further developed in Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, England, and in Italy.,The Molossus belonged to the tribe of the Molossians, from Epirus in northern Greece in about 1200 BC, coming from the north. However, their artifacts did not resemble the Mastiff prototype, as they had a long nose of a narrow type, and a long mane. Varro, however, described a herding dog of Epirus which was white, large-headed, and slightly undershot, used to defend sheep and goats. One group of Alans arrived in what is now Albania in the 5th or 6th centuries BC. Molossis of Epirus is located in Southern Albania. It is most plausible the Alaunt gave rise to the fighting dogs of the Molossi, which were introduced to Britain by Roman invasion in 43 BC. The Alans provided cavalry for Rome, many of whom were deployed to Hadrian's Wall in the second century AD.In the 370s AD, Hun invasions divided the Alani into the Eastern and Western Alans. The Eastern Alani tribes merged with the Ossetians and other nations, introducing their dogs into the bloodlines of many Balkan breeds, such as the \u0160arplaninac, Metchkar, Qen Ghedje, Hellenikos Poimenikos and other livestock guardian dogs of the region. The white-coloured Alaunts may be the direct ancestors of the Balkan breeds, which in turn influenced all other white dogs in the Balkans.,The Western Alans joined the Vandals on their raids through Europe, and by the 410s AD, their fierce dogs were influencing many breeds in France, Spain, Portugal, England, and other countries. This spread the use of the \"Alaunt\" name, which became synonymous with a type of a working dog rather than a specific breed. Through breeding with various scenthounds and sighthounds, some Alaunts became valued large game hunting dogs, existing in a variety of types dictated by regional preferences. In AD 1500, Spain was known for breeding the best Alaunts and used them to conquer the New World.In France, Alaunts were separated into three main categories, based on physical appearance and the duties they performed. The lightest type was the alant gentil, a greyhound-like dog. The original mastiff variety, known as the alant de boucherie, may have contributed to the development of the fighting and baiting dogs of France. The French alants de boucherie were known as alauntz o bouchery in England, famously dramatised by Chaucer in his \"Knight's Tale\" as the mythical hounds of Lycurgus, King of Thrace, and the Alano in Spain and Italy and were termed the original Bulldogs as they were used to control and defend herds of cattle. In Spain, the three categories were the Mastins, Alanos, and Lebrels, further separated as the ayuda (defense types) and the presa (offense types), such as the Perro de presa espa\u00f1ol." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c591" }, "breed": "Alpine Mastiff", "origin": "Swiss and Italian Alps", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_Mastiff", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/1815_Alpine_Mastiff.jpg/220px-1815_Alpine_Mastiff.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5de6" }, "breed": "Alpine Mastiff", "contenido": "The Alpine Mastiff is an extinct molosser dog breed.

After the abolition of slavery, they ceased to exist as a distinct population over time.,They were between a bulldog and a mastiff in size. The muzzle was short, broad, and abruptly truncated. The head was broad and flat, and the lips, deeply pendulous. The medium-sized ears, were also partly pendulous, the tail  rather short, cylindrical, and turned upwards and forwards towards the tip. They were described as a \"rusty wolf-colour\", with black face, lips, and legs. They were very notable for their chasing of slaves. It is not known when the dog was considered a specific breed, but by 1803 it is described thus by Robert Dallas: \"The animal is the size of a very large hound, with ears erect, which are usually cropped at the points; the nose more pointed, but widening very much towards the after-part of the jaw. His coat, or skin, is much harder than that of most dogs, and so must be the whole structure of the body, as the severe beatings he undergoes in training would kill any other species of dog.\",The Cuban mastiff developed from several breeds of bulldogs, mastiffs and cattle dogs, becoming an ideal fighter and property guardian. It is possible that some specimens of this breed were brought to America, where they were employed as watchdogs. They were also used as slave retrievers by the British during the Second Maroon War, by the French during the Saint-Domingue expedition, as well as the Americans in the Southern States. The British Governor of Jamaica, Alexander Lindsay, 6th Earl of Balcarres, sent emissaries to Havana in early 1795, to purchase 100 animals, after hearing of their successful use by the Spanish in chasing slaves and indigenous people in Cuba. Hundreds of hounds were supplied by Cuban breeders to the French during the Haitian revolt in 1803.The breed has been considered extinct since the end of the 19th century, but there have been reports that state that, although no pure dogos cubanos remain, the dogs used in today's fighting pits in Cuba are descendants of crossbreeding between various pit bull-type dogs, Cordoba Fighting Dogs, the Dogo Argentino, and the few pure dogos cubanos which remained at the beginning of the 20th century.

It gradually lost its usefulness as aboriginal hunting methods declined, and became extinct or lost its separate identity through interbreeding with dogs in the 19th century, though some claim the breed still exists in modified form.,The Hare Indian dog was a diminutive, slenderly built domesticated canid with a small head and a narrow, pointed and elongated muzzle. Its pointed ears were erect and broad at the base, and closer together than those of the Canadian Eskimo dog. Its legs were slender and rather long. The tail was thick and bushy, and it curled upwards over its right hip, though not to the extent of the Canadian Eskimo dog. The fur was long and straight, the base colour being white with large, irregular greyish black patches intermingled with various brown shades. The outside of the ears was covered with short brown hair which darkened at the base. The fur in the inside of the ears was long and white. The fur of the muzzle was short and white, as with the legs, though it became longer and thicker at the feet. Black patches were present around the eyes. Like the wolves with which it was sympatric, it had long hair between its toes, which projected over the soles, with naked, callous protuberances being present at the root of the toes and soles, even in winter. In size, it was intermediate to the coyote and the American red fox.,The Hare Indian dog was apparently very playful, and readily befriended strangers, though it was not very docile, and disliked confinement of any kind.  It apparently expressed affection by rubbing its back against people, similar to a cat. In its native homeland, it was not known to bark, though puppies born in Europe learned how to imitate the barking of other dogs. When hurt or afraid, it howled like a wolf, and when curious, it made a sound described as a growl building up to a howl.,The Hare-Indian Dog is very playful, has an affectionate disposition, and is soon gained by kindness.  It is not, however, very docile, and dislikes confinement of every kind.  It is very fond of being caressed, rubs its back against the hand like a cat, and soon makes an acquaintance with a stranger.  Like a wild animal it is very mindful of an injury, nor does it, like a spaniel, crouch under the lash; but if it is conscious of having deserved punishment, it will hover round the tent of its master the whole day, without coming within his reach, even if he calls it.  Its howl, when hurt or afraid, is that of the wolf; but when it sees any unusual object it makes a singular attempt at barking, commencing by a kind of growl, which is not, however, unpleasant, and ending in a prolonged howl.  Its voice is very much like that of the prairie wolf [coyote]. The larger Dogs which we had for draught at Fort Franklin, and which were of the mongrel breed in common use at the fur posts, used to pursue the Hare-Indian Dogs for the purpose of devouring them; but the latter far outstripped them in speed, and easily made their escape.  A young puppy, which I purchased from the Hare Indians, became greatly attached to me, and when about seven months old ran on the snow by the side of my sledge for nine hundred miles, without suffering from fatigue. During this march it frequently of its own accord carried a small twig or one of my mittens for a mile or two; but although very gentle in its manners it showed little aptitude in learning any of the arts which the Newfoundland Dogs so speedily acquire, of fetching and carrying when ordered.  This Dog was killed and eaten by an Indian, on the Saskatchewan, who pretended that he mistook it for a fox. The most extraordinary circumstance in this relation is the great endurance of the puppy, which certainly deserves special notice.

After years of breeding, they were able to create a variety species that could cope with the heat of the Indian summers and retained the intelligence and adaptability of the German breed. Resembling a Samoyed and Pomeranian, they were well suited to the Indian climatic conditions and quickly became popular.,The Indian Spitz became popular due to restrictive import rules imposed by the Indian Government in the 1980s and 1990s. Foreign imports were very hard to access, and Indians turned to the indigenous and local breeds. The Indian Spitz is similar to the European Spitz, though it has adapted to a warmer climate. They are equally comfortable in small apartments and in large, open houses. However, they do need moderate exercise.,They received glamour in Bollywood. In the film Hum Aapke Hain Kaun (1994), a 6-year-old Indian Spitz named Redo played an important role of 'Tuffy'. This was the first movie that hoisted an Indian Spitz onto the screens of India. This dog belonged to the assistant director of the movie Madhukar Sawle. The actress of this film, Madhuri Dixit, later adopted Redo. The dog died in the year 2000 when it was 12 years old.,The Indian Spitz is a small dog, around 33 cm (13 ins) at the withers, with a soft chest, and a fair tail, pure milky white double coat. Their eyes have very white irises that can be greenish or bluish. This is one of the reasons they have such expressive faces that could led humans rely on looking at each other's irises to tell where we are looking and how we feel about things. Not many animals have this feature but many Indian Spitzes have visible irises.,The original Spitz or Pomeranian was bred for hunting in cold conditions, and their white coloring reflects this. Although the same conditions are not found in India, their coloring is attractive and has remained through the years. Some can be white and brown. Generally, they are white all over.,Pointy fox-like ears that are highly makes this breed especially expressive. Thick fur covers the outside of the ears and covers a lot of the insides as well. This can mean they need extra attention when it comes to care and grooming." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4b4" }, "breed": "Japanese Terrier", "origin": "Japan", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Terrier", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Japanese_Terrier_22.04.2012_2pl.jpg/220px-Japanese_Terrier_22.04.2012_2pl.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6ae" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/japanese_terrier.jpg", "good_with_children": 0, "good_with_other_dogs": 0, "shedding": 2, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 0, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 0, "playfulness": 0, "protectiveness": 0, "trainability": 3, "energy": 3, "barking": 0, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 15, "max_height_male": 13, "max_height_female": 13, "max_weight_male": 10, "max_weight_female": 10, "min_height_male": 11, "min_height_female": 11, "min_weight_male": 5, "min_weight_female": 5, "breed": "Japanese Terrier" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5eef" }, "breed": "Japanese Terrier", "contenido": "The Japanese Terrier (\u65e5\u672c\u30c6\u30ea\u30a2, Nihon Teria) is a small terrier native to Japan.

Originally the breed served the people of Sivas, and the Kangal continues to be a popular dog breed in Turkey. According to official Kangal Shepherd Dog organisations in Turkey, including the Cynology Federation of Turkey (K\u00f6pek Irklar\u0131 ve Kinoloji Federasyonu, KIF) and the Ankara Kangal Association (Ankara Kangal Derne\u011fi, ANKADER) the acceptable colours for Kangal are sable and fawn. Kangal shepherd dogs do not come in brindle or Black and Tan.,While the Kangal Shepherd Dog is often referred to as a sheep dog, it is not a herding dog, but rather a flock guardian that lives with the flock of sheep to actively fend off predators of all sizes, and then  hunt them down. The Kangal shepherd is widely regarded as having the most powerful bite force of all domestic dogs. Typically used as protection against wolves, bears, and jackals in its native Turkey, the breed has been exported to African countries like Namibia and Kenya in more recent years due to its intimidating size and capabilities as an effective guardian, where it successfully protects local herds from lions, cheetahs, and similar indigenous big cats, which has had the benefit of not only protecting livestock, but ensuring the continuity of endangered predators due to reduced cullings by local farmers.,The breed's name derives from the contemporary Central Anatolian town of Kangal in Turkey's Sivas Province. The Kangal has been used by shepherds for protection against wolves and other predators for centuries.    ,A DNA study found that the dogs of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan are genetically closest to Kangal dogs, and the researchers propose that the breed may have been brought from Central Asia by the nomadic Turks.,Anatolian Shepherd Dog is the name used in the United States to describe dogs descended from regional Turkish livestock guardian dogs, particularly the Kangal but also the Akbash, from the late 1960s. In 1967 a US Navy Lieutenant who was stationed in Turkey, Robert Ballard, acquired two working livestock guardians Zorba and Peki, from breeders in the Ankara region, Zorba was a long-coated pinto-colored dog and Peki a short-coated buff-colored bitch. In the late 1960s Ballard returned to the United States and took his dogs with him and in 1970 the pair bred their first litter, becoming the foundation stock of the breed in the United States. A breed club was quickly formed and further examples were imported from Turkey. In developing the breed, the American enthusiasts acted without understanding of regional Turkish varieties of shepherd's dogs, with the result that the American dogs could be bred with various coat lengths, colors and color patterns whilst in Turkey the different breeds breed more true to a set coat type. This was further exacerbated by most of these dogs being sourced in the intermediate zone between the main breeding centers of the Akbash and the Kangal, where examples of both types can be found.In subsequent years animosity developed between American breeders, who insisted their dogs were the true Turkish shepherd's dog, and Turkish breeders who believed, and stated, they were an amalgam of various Turkish breeds. Insults and counter-insults were exchanged with American breeders accusing the Turks of marketing dogs of dubious ancestry as independent breeds and the Turks stating the Americans were breeding crossbred dogs. The name Anatolian Shepherd Dog is unknown in Turkey and the breed is sometimes described as having the Turkish name of \u00c7oban K\u00f6pe\u011fi which means 'shepherd's dog', or livestock guardian dog. Since the 1980s Americans have almost exclusively imported Kangals and the Anatolian has increasingly conformed to that breed type. Despite this pups of mixed appearance are still whelped and Turkish authorities still refuse to recognise Anatolians as a purebred Turkish breed." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4ba" }, "breed": "Karakachan dog", "origin": "Bulgaria", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karakachan_dog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Karakatschan.jpg/220px-Karakatschan.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ef6" }, "breed": "Karakachan dog", "contenido": "The Karakachan dog is a breed that originated from Bulgaria.

Due to their conservative stock-breeding traditions, they have preserved some of the oldest breeds of domestic animals in Europe: the Karakachan sheep, Karakachan horse and the Karakachan dog.,In the past, this dog was widely used in Bulgaria as a border army watchdog. Nowadays it is used primarily as a livestock guardian dog and property guard dog.

The Karakachan was officially recognised as a Bulgarian native breed in 2005. They are part of the origin of the Bulgarian Shepherd, but should not be confused as the same breed.,The Karakachan dog is a typical livestock guardian dog, created for guarding its owner's flock and property; it does not hesitate to fight wolves or bears to defend its owner and his family in case of danger. Its ancestors started forming as early as the third millennium BC. The Karakachan dog is a descendant of the dogs of the Thracians, renowned as stock-breeders. The dog is named after the Karakachans. Due to their conservative stock-breeding traditions, they managed to preserve some of the oldest breeds of domestic animals in Europe \u2013 the Karakachan sheep, the Karakachan horse, and, of course, the Karakachan dog.

The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.,It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion dog, and according to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations in 2013.,During the 1890s, attempts were being made to standardise dog breeds. Dogs were being bred to preserve traits that assisted in their job of herding sheep and protecting their flocks from predators. In Germany this was practised within local communities, where shepherds selected and bred dogs. It was recognised that the breed had the necessary skills for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen senses of smell. The results were dogs that were able to do such things, but that differed significantly, both in appearance and ability, from one locality to another.To combat these differences, the Phylax Society was formed in 1891 with the intention of creating standardised development plans for native dog breeds in Germany. The society disbanded after only three years due to ongoing internal conflicts regarding the traits in dogs that the society should promote; some members believed dogs should be bred solely for working purposes, while others believed dogs should be bred also for appearance. While unsuccessful in their goal, the Phylax Society had inspired people to pursue standardising dog breeds independently.,With the rise of large, industrialised cities in Germany, the predator population began to decline, rendering sheepdogs unnecessary. At the same time, the awareness of sheepdogs as a versatile, intelligent class of canine began to rise. Max von Stephanitz, an ex-cavalry captain and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was an ex-member of the Phylax Society who firmly believed dogs should be bred for working. He admired the intelligence, strength and ability of Germany's native sheepdogs, but could not find any one single breed that satisfied him as the perfect working dog.In 1899, von Stephanitz was attending a dog show when he was shown a dog named Hektor Linksrhein. Hektor was the product of few generations of selective breeding and completely fulfilled what von Stephanitz believed a working dog should be. He was pleased with the strength of the dog and was so taken by the animal's intelligence, loyalty, and beauty, that he purchased him immediately. After purchasing the dog he changed his name to Horand von Grafrath and von Stephanitz founded the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde (Society for German Shepherd Dogs). Horand was declared to be the first German Shepherd Dog, and was the first dog added to the society's breed register. In just a few decades of the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde's establishment, the breed became one of the world's most popular and numerous, a position it has maintained to this day. By 1923, the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde claimed 50,000 dues-paying members in more than 500 branches in Germany alone.Horand became the center-point of the breeding programs and was bred with dogs belonging to other society members that displayed desirable traits and with dogs from Thuringia, Franconia, and W\u00fcrttemberg. Fathering many pups, Horand's most prolific was Hektor von Schwaben. Hektor was inbred with another of Horand's offspring and produced Heinz von Starkenburg, Beowulf, and Pilot, who later sired a total of 84 pups, mostly through being inbred with Hektor's other offspring. This inbreeding was deemed necessary in order to fix the traits being sought in the breed. Beowulf's progeny also were inbred and it is from these pups that all German shepherds draw a genetic link. It is believed the society accomplished its goal mostly due to von Stephanitz's strong, uncompromising leadership and he is therefore credited with being the creator of the German Shepherd Dog.During the first half of the twentieth century, the breed came to be strongly identified with Imperial and Nazi Germany, because of its association with purity and militarism. German shepherds were coveted as \"germanische Urhunde\", being close to the wolf, and became very fashionable during the Nazi era. Adolf Hitler acquired a German Shepherd named \"Prinz\" in 1921, during his years of poverty, but he had been forced to lodge the dog elsewhere. However, she managed to escape and return to him. Hitler, who adored the loyalty and obedience of the dog, thereafter developed a great liking for the breed. Hitler kept several more of the breed, including Blondi, who was among several dogs in the 'F\u00fchrerbunker' during the Battle of Berlin at the end of the Second World War. Dogs played a role in Nazi propaganda by portraying Hitler as an animal lover. Preparing for his suicide, Hitler ordered Dr. Werner Haase to test a cyanide capsule on Blondi, and the dog died as a result. Erna Flegel, a nurse who worked at the emergency casualty station in the Reich Chancellery stated in 2005 that Blondi's death had affected the people in the bunker more than Eva Braun's suicide. German Shepherds were also used widely as guard dogs at Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust.When the German Shepherd was introduced to the United States it was initially a popular dog. But as the dogs' popularity grew, it became associated as a dangerous breed owned by gangsters and bootleggers. The reputation of the German shepherds as a dangerous breed had grown to such an extent that it was briefly banned to import them in Australia in 1929. Potential legislation was even considered to require that all German shepherds in South Australia be sterilised.,The breed was named Deutscher Sch\u00e4ferhund, by von Stephanitz, literally translating to \"German Shepherd Dog\".  At the time, all other herding dogs in Germany were referred to by this name; they thus became known as Altdeutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde, or Old German herding dogs.,The direct translation of the name was adopted for use in the stud-book; however, at the end of the First World War, it was believed that the inclusion of the word \"German\" would harm the breed's popularity, due to the anti-German sentiment of the era. The breed was officially renamed by the UK Kennel Club to \"Alsatian Wolf Dog\", after the French region of Alsace bordering Germany.Eventually, the appendage \"wolf dog\" was dropped, after numerous campaigns by breeders who were worried that becoming known as a wolf-dog hybrid would affect the breed's popularity and legality. The name Alsatian remained for five decades, until 1977, when successful campaigns by dog enthusiasts pressured the British kennel clubs to allow the breed to be registered again as German Shepherds. The word \"Alsatian\" once appeared in parentheses as part of the formal breed name of the American Kennel Club and was removed in 2010." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4c3" }, "breed": "Kintamani", "origin": "Indonesia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintamani_(dog)", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Kintamani.jpg/220px-Kintamani.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5eff" }, "breed": "Kintamani", "contenido": "The Kintamani (Indonesian: anjing kintamani) or the Kintamani-Bali Dog is a dog native to the Indonesian island of Bali and originated from the Kintamani region.

The Bali street dogs are most closely aligned with the Australian dingo, more distantly related to AKC recognized breeds of Asian origin but not those of European origin. Therefore, the Kintamani dog was developed from Balinese dogs with little loss of genetic diversity.The ancestors of the Balinese street dog arrived on Bali around 3,000 years ago and had been largely isolated since. A rabies control measure implemented in 1926 meant that foreign dogs could not enter Bali. Therefore, these dogs have free-bred and free-roamed for thousands of years with limited genetic change.,The Kintamani looks something like a mix between the Samoyed and a Malamute. They have long hair, a broad face, a flat forehead, and flat cheeks like Chinese dogs such as the Chow Chow and are amenable to life as a pet.  Whilst many live much the same kind of life as an average village dog, they dig holes to nest their young and some live in small caves among the boulders around Kintamani. They are locally considered good-looking dogs are more often sought after as good pets. The Kintamani dog is gentle around people, yet retains enough assertive behavior to render it a noteworthy (but not vicious) watchdog.,The most desired coat color is white \u2013 preferably with apricot-tipped ears. Breeders often confine the dogs to cold dark caves near the Kintamani volcano, insisting it an essential step in developing the thick white coat. The FCI standard also accepts fawn (beige), red, brindle, and black colours. In fawn, red, and brindle variations the black mask is preferred.,The withers height of the female Kintamani dog is 44\u201352 centimeters (17\u201320 inches), 49\u201357 centimeters (19\u201322 inches) for the male, about the same as the stature of the Bali street dog. The desired physical traits of the Kintamani dog include erect ears, forwardly curved tail held at the midline, medium to longhaired coat, almond-shaped brown eyes, and black skin pigment.,Bali street dogs come in many colors and coat patterns, and they are almost always shorthaired and straight- to curve- tailed.

It was first bred in the 19th century to control vermin, notably rats, at which it excelled. So efficient at the task was it that it often appeared in rat-baiting pits until that sport, which had effectively been illegal in the UK since 1835, finally died out at the beginning of the 20th century.,The breed is generally healthy, although dogs can be affected by several inheritable genetic disorders. A crash in the number of registered Manchester Terriers following the Second World War has resulted in the Kennel Club categorising it as a vulnerable native breed, in danger of extinction.,The Manchester Terrier was developed from the Black and Tan Terrier and the Whippet.. Writing in the early 16th century, John Caius describes a Manchester-terrier type of dog in De Canibus Britannicis, and at the beginning of the 19th century Sydenham Edwards described what he called a Manchester Terrier in his Cynographia Britannica.The Black and Tan Terrier had an almost legendary status as a rat killer, an ability that was much prized in overcrowded and rat-infested cities such as 19th-century Manchester. The sport of rat baiting, in which a terrier was thrown into an enclosure filled with rats, and timed to see how long it took the dog to kill them all, had become popular by the early 19th century along with rabbit coursing. In an effort to produce a dog that could excel at both sports, the breeder John Hulme decided to cross a Black and Tan Terrier with a Whippet. Similar dogs were bred in various other parts of England, but by 1860 Manchester had become the breed centre for these new terriers, and so they became known as Manchester Terriers. Other breeds, including the Italian Greyhound and the Dachshund, may also have been introduced into the bloodline.The Manchester Terrier gained the nickname of the Gentleman's Terrier in Victorian times, because of its dignified demeanour.,By the early 19th century a closer facsimile to the current Manchester terrier had evolved. In The Dog in Health and Disease by J. A. Walsh, a full chapter was devoted to the black and tan, for the first time recognising it as an established breed. The description given by Walsh is still relevant: Smooth haired, long tapering nose, narrow flat skull, eyes small and bright, chest rather deep than wide, only true colour black and tan." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4db" }, "breed": "McNab dog", "origin": "United States", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNab_dog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/McNab-Shepherd-dodger.jpg/220px-McNab-Shepherd-dodger.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f22" }, "breed": "McNab dog", "contenido": "The McNab Dog, also called the McNab Shepherd or McNab Collie is a herding dog that originated in Hopland, Mendocino County, Northern California.

Until recently, the McNab was little known outside California, but in last three decades have seen a gain in popularity and geographic dispersal of the breed.,The appearance of the McNab can vary considerably.  The dog is medium-sized with females standing 16\u201321 inches at the shoulder and weighing 30\u201350 pounds and males standing 18\u201325 inches at the shoulder and weighing 35\u201365 pounds.

McNabs come in colors of black, red, blonde, blue, lilac and sable with variations of solid, added white or added white and tan (tri colored).  Their eyes are set well apart, almond shaped, and brown, hazel, or copper colored.  The McNab coat is close, dense and weather resistant.  They can have a slick single short coat, a short double coat, or a medium length single coat, but their fur is never long.  One of the distinctive features of the McNab is their cat-like feet, which contribute to their agility.,The McNab is currently not recognized as a standardized breed by any major kennel club, including the American Kennel Club (AKC). This status may change in the future.,In 2014, a group of McNab Shepherd breeders and enthusiasts established the McNab Shepherd Registry (MSR). According to the MSR, their goal is to continue the betterment, advancement and welfare of the McNab Shepherd. The MSR is what is known as a \"founding registry\" because they exclusively utilize discovered genetic markers and DNA verification for registration.,Beginning in 2014, the MSR worked with Mars Veterinary on a study in an attempt to establish a unique genetic signature for the McNab Shepherd.  Samples collected from McNabs across the United States were evaluated for their genetic signature and found to support the creation of a unique breed signature for the McNab. Additionally, the tested dogs were also evaluated for certain physical traits and over 100 disease-causing mutations to help establish a baseline for these in the McNab population." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4ea" }, "breed": "Norwegian Elkhound", "origin": "Norway", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Elkhound", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Norwegian_Elkhound.jpg/220px-Norwegian_Elkhound.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6c9" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/norwegian_elkhound.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 4, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 5, "trainability": 4, "energy": 4, "barking": 4, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 15, "max_height_male": 20.5, "max_height_female": 20.5, "max_weight_male": 55, "max_weight_female": 48, "min_height_male": 20.5, "min_height_female": 20.5, "min_weight_male": 55, "min_weight_female": 48, "breed": "Norwegian Elkhound" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f3b" }, "breed": "Norwegian Elkhound", "contenido": "The Norwegian Elkhound is one of the Northern Spitz-type breed of dog and is the National Dog of Norway.

The Norwegian Elkhound was first presented at a dog exhibition in Norway in 1877.,The AKC breed name \"Norwegian Elkhound\" is a direct translation from its original Norwegian name Norsk elghund, meaning \"Norwegian moose dog.\" The breed's object in the hunt is to independently track down and hold the moose at bay\u2014jumping in and out toward the moose, distracting its attention, while signaling to the hunters by barking very loudly\u2014until the hunter who follows the sound can arrive to shoot it.

Obsolete names for the breed include Shepherd's Dog and bob-tailed sheep-dog. The nickname Bob-tail (or Bobtail) originates from how dogs of the breed traditionally had their tails docked. Old English Sheepdogs can grow very long coats with fur covering the face and eyes and do not shed unless brushed.,The Old English Sheepdog is a large dog, immediately recognizable by its long, thick, shaggy grey and white coat, with fur covering their face and eyes. The ears lie flat to the head. Historically, the breed's tail was commonly docked (resulting in a panda bear\u2013like rear end), but tailed Old English sheepdogs are now common, as many countries have outlawed cosmetic docking.  When the dog has a tail, it has long fur (feathering), is low set, and normally hangs down. The Old English Sheepdog stands lower at the shoulder than at the loin, and walks with a \"bear-like roll from the rear\".Height at the withers is at least 61 cm (24 in), with females slightly smaller than males. The body is short and compact, and ideal weights are not specified in the breed standards, but may be as much as 46 kg (101 lb) for large males.Colour of the double coat may be any shade of grey, grizzle, black, blue, or blue merle, with optional white markings. The undercoat is water resistant. Puppies are born with a black and white coat, and it is only after the puppy coat has been shed that the more common grey or silver shaggy hair appears. Old English Sheepdogs only shed when they are brushed.,Undocked Old English Sheepdogs are becoming a more common sight as many countries have now banned docking. The Kennel Club (UK) and The Australian National Kennel Council breed standards do not express a preference for (legally) docked or un-docked animals, and either can be shown. The American Kennel Club breed standard states that the tail should be \"docked close to the body, when not naturally bob tailed\", even though the practice of cosmetic docking is currently opposed by the American Veterinary Medical Association.  It is believed that the practice of tail docking came about in the 18th century as a result of taxation laws that required working dogs to be docked as evidence of their working status, but nowadays, in places where the practice is still legal, tail docking is mainly performed for purely cosmetic reasons.,The Old English Sheepdog comes from the pastoral type dogs of England. A small drop-eared dog seen in a 1771 painting by Gainsborough is believed by some to represent the early type of the Old English Sheepdog. In the early 19th century a bobtailed drovers dog, called the Smithfield or Cotswold Cor, was noticed in the southwestern counties of England and may have been an ancestor. Most fanciers agree that the Bearded Collie was among the original stock used in developing today's breed.  Some speculate that the Russian Owtchar was among the breed's ancestors.The Old English Sheepdog was at first called the \"Shepherd's Dog\" and was exhibited for the first time at a show in Birmingham, England, in 1873. There were only three entries, and the judge felt the quality of the dogs was so poor that he offered only a second placing. From that beginning, the breed became a popular show dog, and, although the shape of the dog itself has changed very little over the years, elaborate grooming including backcombing and powdering the fur was recorded as early as 1907. The breed was exported to the United States in the 1880s, and by the turn of the 20th century, five of the ten wealthiest American families bred and showed the Old English Sheepdog. The breed continues to be a popular show dog today.,The best recent finish of an Old English Sheepdog at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show was in 2013 when Bugaboo's Picture Perfect was awarded Reserve Best in Show." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4f2" }, "breed": "Olde English Bulldogge", "origin": "United States", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olde_English_Bulldogge", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/UKC_Olde_English_Bulldogge_Male.jpg/220px-UKC_Olde_English_Bulldogge_Male.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f45" }, "breed": "Olde English Bulldogge", "contenido": "The Olde English Bulldogge is an American dog breed, recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) in January 2014.  The breed is listed in the UKC Guardian Dog Group.  Five years prior to UKC recognition, the breed was registered by the former Canine Developmental, Health and Performance Registry (CDHPR), a privately held business located in Kalamazoo, Michigan. In the early 2000s, CDHPR had been working with the UKC under a unique agreement to develop breeding plans and strategies in an effort to produce improved breeds of dogs that would be accepted as purebred and, therefore, eligible for UKC registration.In the early 1970s, dog breeder David Leavitt of Coatesville, Pennsylvania, wanted to \"recreate a Bulldog with the looks, health and athleticism of the 18th Century Bulldog which was originally created for the English sport of bull baiting between the years 1100 to 1835\".  In an effort to rapidly achieve his goal for a purebred dog, Leavitt modeled his program after a livestock line breeding scheme developed by Nathan Fechimer, a professor in the Department of Dairy Science, Ohio State University. The result was an athletic breed that looks similar to the bulldogs of 1820, but with a friendly temperament, fewer health issues, and with longevity reaching into the teens.  U.S. researchers have said the Olde English Bulldogge is a \"viable candidate\" as an outcross on which to rebuild the Bulldog; a breed that genetic studies have suggested is so inbred that it \"cannot be returned to health without an infusion of new bloodlines.\",The Olde English Bulldogge was an attempt to recreate the \"Regency Period Bull Baiter\" and was developed in the early 1970s by David Leavitt, of Coatesville, PA. Leavitt began his project in 1971 utilizing the cattle line breeding scheme of Dr. Fechimer from Ohio State University. The goal was to create a dog with the look, health, and athleticism of the original bull-baiting dogs, but with a much less aggressive temperament. The foundation crosses consisted of one-half Bulldog, one-sixth American Bulldog, one-sixth Bullmastiff and one-sixth of other breeds. After many planned crosses, the Olde English Bulldogge emerged and began to breed true.Leavitt formed the Olde English Bulldogge Association (OEBA) to maintain the breed's stud book and issue registration papers to future offspring. During the 1980s, Ben and Karen Campetti from Sandisfield, Massachusetts, worked closely with Leavitt in breeding the Olde English Bulldogge. In 1993, Leavitt stopped breeding and turned the OEBA registry as well as his personal breeding stock over to Working Dog Inc. which was owned and operated by Michael Walz of Pennsylvania.In 2001 the Olde English Bulldogge Kennel Club (OEBKC) was formed, and in 2005 David Leavitt was involved with merging the Olde English Bulldogge Association's registry with that of the OEBKC's. The Olde English Bulldogge was enrolled with the Canine Developmental Health and Performance Registry (CDHPR) in August 2008 in order to evaluate the breed for recognition within the UKC as a purebred breed of dog. In 2013, the UKC announced that the Olde English Bulldogge would become a fully recognized breed as of January 1, 2014. The OEBKC is currently the recognized Parent Club for the breed with the United Kennel Club (UKC).,In order to maintain his original breeding aims and to distinguish his line of Olde English Bulldogges from those of other breeders, in 2004 David Leavitt named his line of dogs Leavitt Bulldogs (sometimes spelled \"Bulldogges\"), founding the Leavitt Bulldog Association the following year.  The UKC recognizes dogs registered with the Leavitt Bulldog Association as Olde English Bulldogges, along with those registered with the Olde English Bulldogge Kennel Club and the Olde Bulldogge Club Europe." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4f6" }, "breed": "Papillon", "origin": "Belgium / France", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillon_(dog)", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/RileyPapillon.JPG/220px-RileyPapillon.JPG", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6cf" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/papillon.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 5, "playfulness": 5, "protectiveness": 4, "trainability": 5, "energy": 4, "barking": 5, "min_life_expectancy": 14, "max_life_expectancy": 16, "max_height_male": 11, "max_height_female": 11, "max_weight_male": 10, "max_weight_female": 10, "min_height_male": 8, "min_height_female": 8, "min_weight_male": 5, "min_weight_female": 5, "breed": "Papillon" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f4a" }, "breed": "Papillon", "contenido": "The Papillon (French pronunciation: \u200b[papij\u0254\u0303], French for 'butterfly[-eared]'), also called the Continental Toy Spaniel, is a breed of dog, of the spaniel type. One of the oldest of the toy spaniels, it derives its name from its characteristic butterfly-like look of the long and fringed hair on the ears. A Papillon with dropped ears is called a Phalene.,Papillons are very intelligent and self-assured dogs that have a very easy time learning new tricks. These dogs can be sociable with children and strangers, but are generally reserved around new people. They can also be socialized to get along well with other pets, but care should be taken with rambunctious pets or cats with claws, as they may injure them. If not properly socialized, Papillons can be distrustful and exhibit aggressive tendencies toward other dogs and people. Papillons may also be very playful and affectionate. Widely known as great companion dogs, they have the spirit and energy to keep up with active families, but can also be calm enough to be happy with sleeping in the arms of an equally affectionate owner. Due to their high energy level, they demand an augmented exercise routine, relative to the average companion breed. Papillons are known as excellent watchdogs, as they will alert their owner to changes in their environment. They may be considered garrulous like many other toy dogs. They can withstand heat, but are more sensitive to cold temperatures because of their single-coated fur, and should not be left outside unattended in cold weather.,The most iconic aspect of Papillons are their ears, which are large and well fringed, giving them a butterfly wing-like appearance. Papillons are particolored or white with patches of any color. An all-white dog or a dog with no white is disqualified from the conformation show ring. A blaze (area of white extending down between the eyes) and noseband is preferred over a solid-colored head, but not required. Nose, eye rims, and lips should be black. Paw pads vary in color from black to pink, depending on the coloring of the dog.,Papillons can be registered with the American Kennel Club as the following colors and markings, with types for show purposes indicated with S for standard or A for alternate:,The American Kennel Club breed standard indicates a conformance fault that may be penalized: failure of the non-white color to cover the front and back of both ears and to extend from the ears over both eyes. Not penalized are a slight extension of the white collar onto the base of the ears, or a few white hairs interspersed in the color \u2013 as long as \"the butterfly appearance is not sacrificed\".,Two ear variations of this breed are seen, the completely upright ears of the more common Papillon, and the dropped spaniel-like ears of the Phal\u00e8ne. The Phal\u00e8ne are likely a throwback to their spaniel ancestors. The American Kennel Club and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) consider the Phal\u00e8ne and the Papillon the same breed.,The temperament of Papillons is that of a happy, friendly, adventurous dog. They are generally neither shy nor aggressive. Papillons can make excellent family dogs, but should be watched around little children, as should any dog, due to a small child's lack of understanding of a dog's behavior and the likelihood that they will do something to upset the dog. Given the intelligence of Papillons, they require rigorous training and mental stimulation to prevent behavioral issues arising from boredom. According to Dr Stanley Coren, an expert on animal intelligence, Papillons are among the top ten brightest dogs, ranking 8th out of 138 breeds tested." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4f7" }, "breed": "Parson Russell Terrier", "origin": "England", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parson_Russell_Terrier", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/05052881_PRT_braun_rau.jpg/220px-05052881_PRT_braun_rau.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6d0" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/parson_russell_terrier.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 5, "shedding": 2, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 4, "energy": 5, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 13, "max_life_expectancy": 15, "max_height_male": 14, "max_height_female": 14, "max_weight_male": 17, "max_weight_female": 17, "min_height_male": 14, "min_height_female": 14, "min_weight_male": 13, "min_weight_female": 13, "breed": "Parson Russell Terrier" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f4b" }, "breed": "Parson Russell Terrier", "contenido": "The Parson Russell Terrier is a breed of small white terrier that was the original Fox Terrier of the 18th century. The breed is named after the Reverend Jack Russell, credited with the creation of this type of dog. It is the recognised conformation show variety of the Jack Russell Terrier and was first recognised in 1990 in the United Kingdom as the Parson Jack Russell Terrier. In America, it was first recognised as the Jack Russell Terrier in 1997. The name was changed to its current form in 1999 in the UK and by 2008 all international kennel clubs recognised it under the new name.,A mostly white breed with either a smooth, rough or broken coat, it conforms to a narrower range of sizes than the Jack Russell. It is a feisty, energetic terrier, suited to sports and able to get along with children and other animals. It has a range of breed-related health issues, mainly relating to eye disorders.,This breed shares a common history with the Jack Russell Terrier until the early 1980s.This type of small white terrier dates back to the work of the Reverend John Russell, born in 1795. In 1819 he purchased a small white and tan terrier bitch named Trump from a milkman in the hamlet of Elmsford. She formed the basis for his breeding programme, and by the 1850s the dogs were recognised as a distinct type of Fox Terrier.In 1894, the Devon and Somerset Badger Club was founded by Arthur Blake Heinemann who created the first breed standard for this type of terrier. The club was formed with the aim of promoting badger digging, rather than fox hunting. By the turn of the 20th century, the name of John Russell had become associated with this type of terrier. The Devon and Somerset Badger Club would go on to be renamed the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club and continued until just before World War II when the club folded.In 1983, the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club (PJRTC) was reformed with the aim of seeking Kennel Club recognition for the breed. The initial application was turned down, but after several further rejections, the Parson Jack Russell Terrier was recognised on 9 January 1990 as a variant of the Fox Terrier, with the United Kennel Club following suit in 1991. The American Kennel Club recognised the breed as the Jack Russell Terrier effective 1 November 1997.On 1 August 1999, the PJRTC successfully petitioned the Kennel Club (UK) to change the name of the breed to the Parson Russell Terrier, with the name of the breed club following suit. The international kennel association, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, recognised the Parson Russell Terrier on 4 June 2001. The American Kennel Club updated the name of the recognised breed from Jack Russell Terrier on 1 April 2003. The United Kennel Club adopted the new name on 23 April 2008.The Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC), New Zealand Kennel Club and United Kennel Club (UKC) are the only three major kennel clubs to recognise both the Jack Russell Terrier and the Parson Russell Terrier separately. In 2009, there were 18 Parsons registered with the ANKC compared to 1073 Jack Russells.,The Parson Russell Terrier is bred to conform to a conformation show standard. Unlike its close relative, the Jack Russell Terrier, Parson Russell Terriers have noticeably longer legs that are about as tall as the length of the Terrier's body.  It is a predominantly white breed with black, tan or tricolour markings and an easy to groom coat which is either smooth or broken (similar to a smooth coat, but with some longer hair on the head, face, legs or body). The breed standard does not recognise a Parson Russell with a curly or rough coat. There is a clear outline with only a hint of eyebrows and beard should the dog be broken coated. They possess moderately thick small \"V\" shaped drop ears with the tip pointed towards the eyes. The nose of the dog should be black. The normal range of sizes is between 13\u201314 inches (33\u201336 cm) tall at the withers, with a weight around 13\u201317 pounds (5.9\u20137.7 kg).The Parson Russell has a relatively square outline, with a body about as long as the dog is tall. Compared to the Jack Russell Terrier, the Parson Russell has a longer head and a larger chest along with overall a slightly larger body size. The Parson retains the flat skull but not the elongated shape of the Fox Terrier, and with lower set ears. In addition, the Jack Russell Terrier has a greater variation in size, ranging between 10\u201315 inches (25\u201338 cm) in height at the withers.Two hands should be able to span the chest of the dog behind its elbows, with the thumbs at the withers. This is required in show judging, with the judge lifting the dog's front legs gently off the ground in this motion in order to measure the size of the chest. The judges fingers should meet under the chest and the thumbs on top of the spine. The American Kennel Club describes this as a \"significant factor and a critical part of the judging process.\" It is not done to measure the size of the chest, but rather to feel for the correct shape.Under the show standard, there are several physical points which would be treated as faults in the show ring. These are for the height of the dog at the withers to be outside of the standard range, or for the dog to possess either pricked up ears, a liver or brown coloured nose, an overshot or undershot jawline or to have brindle markings." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4fe" }, "breed": "Perro de Presa Canario", "origin": "Canary Islands, Spain", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perro_de_Presa_Canario", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Presacanariobody.jpg/220px-Presacanariobody.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6d3" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/perro_de_presa_canario.jpg", "good_with_children": 1, "good_with_other_dogs": 1, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 1, "drooling": 4, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 1, "playfulness": 1, "protectiveness": 5, "trainability": 3, "energy": 2, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 9, "max_life_expectancy": 11, "max_height_male": 26, "max_height_female": 26, "max_weight_male": 110, "max_weight_female": 110, "min_height_male": 22, "min_height_female": 22, "min_weight_male": 84, "min_weight_female": 84, "breed": "Perro de Presa Canario" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f53" }, "breed": "Perro de Presa Canario", "contenido": "The Presa Canario is a Spanish breed of large dog of mastiff or catch dog type.

It was traditionally used as a guard dog, as a herding dog for both sheep and cattle, and for dog-fighting, which was legal in Spain until 1936 and may have continued clandestinely thereafter.:\u200a587\u200a,The Presa Canario derives from the Bardino Majorero, which was formerly distributed throughout the Canary Islands. Dogs of this type were cross-bred with various dogs of molossoid type introduced to the islands at different times during the colonial period. The Presa Canario was particularly influenced by dogs brought from the British Isles with the large influx of British residents in the late nineteenth century.:\u200a587\u200aBy the 1960s it was close to extinction. A breed society, the Club Espa\u00f1ol del Presa Canario, was formed in 1982, and drew up a provisional breed standard, which was published by the government of the islands. The standard was approved by the Real Sociedad Canina de Espa\u00f1a in 1989.:\u200a588\u200a In 1991 the dog was included in an official list of national symbols of the Canary Islands as a symbol of the island of Gran Canaria.:\u200a2610\u200a It was officially recognised by the Spanish national government in 2001.The breed was provisionally accepted by the Federation Cynologique Internationale in 2001 under the name Dogo Canario; it was fully accepted in 2011. In December 2018, at the request of the Real Sociedad Canina de Espa\u00f1a, the name was changed to Presa Canario.Importation and sale of the breed is prohibited in Australia and New Zealand.,The Presa Canario is a large dog with a heavy muscular body. ,Dogs stand 60\u201366 cm at the withers and weigh some 50\u201365 kg; bitches stand about 56\u201362 cm and weigh approximately 10 kg less.The head is broad, massive, square, and powerful brachycephalic shape. Proper head and good expression are part of the breed standard, and are manifest in the best breed specimens. The ears are normally cropped, both to create a more formidable expression and to prevent damage while working with cattle. If cropped, the ears stand erect. In countries where ear-cropping is banned, the ears are close fitting to the head; they hang down and should be pendant or \"rose\"-shaped. The upper lip is pendulous, although not excessively. Seen from the front, the upper and lower lips come together to form an inverted V. The flews are slightly divergent. The inside of the lips is a dark colour.The breed is also characterized by a sloping topline (with the rear being slightly higher than the shoulders). Another characteristic of the breed is the shape of the paws (cat foot) and the catlike movement of the animal. The body is mesomorphic, that is, slightly longer than the dog is tall, contributing to the feline movement.,The Presa Canario was traditionally used as a guard dog, as a herding dog for both sheep and cattle, and for dog-fighting, which was legal in Spain until 1936 and may have continued clandestinely thereafter.:\u200a587\u200a Until the 1950s it remained a common practice in all of the islands." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c501" }, "breed": "Pharaoh Hound", "origin": "Malta", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh_Hound", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Pies_faraona_e34.jpg/220px-Pies_faraona_e34.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6d5" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/pharaoh_hound.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 5, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 4, "energy": 4, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 14, "max_height_male": 25, "max_height_female": 25, "max_weight_male": 55, "max_weight_female": 55, "min_height_male": 23, "min_height_female": 23, "min_weight_male": 45, "min_weight_female": 45, "breed": "Pharaoh Hound" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f59" }, "breed": "Pharaoh Hound", "contenido": "The Pharaoh Hound or Kelb tal-Fenek is a Maltese breed of hunting dog.

French colonist recognized the distinct dogs as a unique breed in the 19th century, and two resided at the Jardin d\u2019Acclimitation in Paris. Historically, Phu Quoc Ridgebacks were not purposefully bred, instead relying on random pairings in the relative isolation of island life to continue to maintain their unique population.  According to native Ph\u00fa Qu\u1ed1c islanders, there were originally three sizes of the breed, each uniquely bred to hunt different sizes of game over different terrains. Unfortunately, purebred examples became scarce after the introduction of non-native dogs to the island, with many French writers noting that the breed was near extinction by the turn of the 20th century. Despite the near extinction, genetic studies indicate that the Phu Quoc Ridgeback population is genetically diverse. The breed population has been resurging as public interest grows.

The Poitevin typically stands 60 to 72 centimetres (24 to 28 in) at the withers and weighs 20.5 to 30.5 kilograms (45 to 67 lb), they have a flat gently sloping skull, a long narrow tapering muzzle, a long slender well muscled neck, long straight heavily boned legs and a long tail. The Poitevin's short coat is usually tricolour, all other breeds of tricolour hounds are sometimes described as having Poitevin heritage.The Poitevin is renowned for its speed, stamina, scenting abilities and melodious voice whilst hunting, packs have been known to reach speeds of 56 kilometres per hour (35 mph) and to hunt for up to 7 hours. In his book La V\u00e9nerie, Pierre de Coss\u00e9 Brissac, 12th Duke of Brissac said of the Poitevin \"he is able to chase the quarry more than 7 hours. Because of his speed, the Poitevin's nickname is 'Greyhound among the French hounds'.\".Whilst not shy, the Poitevin is known to be more aloof than many other hound breeds and does not adapt well when not kept in a pack environment.,Poitevins descend from 12 English Staghounds that were gifted to the Dauphin of France in 1692, some of the offspring of these hounds were given to Fran\u00e7ois de Larrye, Marquis of Haut-Poitou who crossed them with local hounds, the offspring of this crossbreeding resulted in strong, athletic tricoloured hounds that were used by the Marquis to hunt wolf, the first examples of the breed. In addition to the Larrye pack two other packs of Poitevins were bred both named after their owners, the Montemboeuf and C\u00e9ris, these two packs were distinguished from the Larrye hounds in being bicoloured (orange and white) and both were considered inferior to the Larrye hounds.During the French revolution the fortunes of Poitevin were to suffer greatly, the then Marquis de Larrye was beheaded in 1793 during the Reign of Terror and the Larrye pack was dispersed and the breed almost disappeared. After the revolution, two brothers Emile and Arthur de la Besage of Montmorillon who lived in Poitou sought to revive the breed, they collected whatever remaining Poitevins they could, including two from the Larrye pack, and reestablished a pack. In 1842 disaster was to strike the de la Besage hounds with an outbreak of rabies in the kennels nearly destroying the pack, the breed was revived by the importation of English Foxhounds, a carefully considered crossbreeding program was implemented and within three generations the Foxhound influence was barely perceptible within the pack.The breed suffered greatly during the First and Second World Wars and at the end of the Second World War further outcrossings to English Foxhounds were necessary to reconstitute the breed.,Whilst the Poitevin was originally created to hunt the wolf, several packs are still maintained in France but today are used to hunt boar and deer in the traditions of the 'Grande V\u00e9n\u00e9rie'. The Poitevin was central to the development of the two most popular of France's packhound breeds, the Grand Anglo-Fran\u00e7ais Tricolore and Chien Fran\u00e7ais Tricolore, as well as the Anglo-Fran\u00e7ais de Petite V\u00e9nerie." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c50f" }, "breed": "Pont-Audemer Spaniel", "origin": "France", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pont-Audemer_Spaniel", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/04031158_Epagneul_Pont_Audemer.jpg/220px-04031158_Epagneul_Pont_Audemer.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f69" }, "breed": "Pont-Audemer Spaniel", "contenido": "The Pont-Audemer Spaniel or Epagneul Pont-Audemer is a rare breed of French gundog. It originated in the nineteenth century from different breeds of water spaniels, and took more of a setter role in hunting than that of a traditional spaniel. Following the Second World War, the breed's numbers dropped so low that the breed club decided to allow cross breeding with other breeds because of fears of the existing stock becoming overly inbred. In 1980, the breed club was merged with that of the Picardy Spaniel.,The breed is alleged to have been developed in the Pont-Audemer region of France in the nineteenth century. While the exact origin of the breed isn't known, it is thought that stock from both the English Water Spaniel and Irish Water Spaniels may have played a part in the breed's original makeup. In the early 20th century, outside France, they were considered more useful as a setter than doing typical spaniel type work.The breed's numbers were never large, and so few examples existed after World War II that in 1949 the President of the Pont-Audemer breed club in France allowed for other breeds, including the Irish Water Spaniel, to cross-breed with the existing population in order to alleviate the risk of inbreeding what few Pont-Audemer Spaniels remained. However the breed's population remained low, and in 1980 at the recommendation of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Centrale Canine, the Pont-Audemer breed club was merged with that of the Picardy Spaniel.The Pont-Audermer Spaniel is recognized by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, the international kennel association. It is recognised in the United States by the United Kennel Club, in the club's Gundog Group. Other breed registries that recognize the Pont-Audemer include the Continental Kennel Club, the International Canine Kennel Club, and the American Rare Breed Association.,The Pont-Audemer Spaniel is a medium-sized dog, weighing 44 to 60 pounds (20\u201327 kg), and standing around 50\u201358 centimetres (20\u201323 in) at the withers. It is different from most sporting dog breeds in the USA and UK in its length, and the pointed quality of the muzzle. The Pont-Audemer Spaniel's coat is curly or, at the very least, quite wavy, but smooth around the face. The most common pattern is brown and white roan but a solid brown coat is also acceptable. Both coat patterns can have red-brown \u201cdead leaf glints\u201d. Black or tan markings are faults. The hair on the face is short. The topknot can take up to five years to fully develop. Most Pontos have docked tails. Tails that are left intact are usually well feathered like that of a setter, although it is not unheard of for a Ponto to have the shorthaired \u201crat-tail\u201d of an Irish Water Spaniel.,Though hardy, as well as hard-working, the breed has the typical spaniel traits of being easy to train, gentle, and affectionate.  The dogs are known to have a fun-loving quality and in France are said to be le petit clown des marais (the little clown of the marshes).Pont-Audemer Spaniels are usually found in a working gundog environment, and are rarely kept as mere family pets.  The dogs specialize as water dogs. At the start of the 20th century they were prized for their use in hunting wild ducks in either the water or marshy conditions.

The breed is divided into four varieties based on size, the Standard Poodle, Medium Poodle, Miniature Poodle and Toy Poodle, although the Medium Poodle variety is not universally recognised.,The Poodle most likely originated in Germany, although it is also claimed to be from France. The Standard Poodle was originally used by wildfowl hunters to retrieve game from water. The smaller varieties of the breed were bred from the original in France where they were once commonly used as circus performers, but have become popular companion dogs.,A majority of cynologists believe the Poodle originated in Germany, and the dog they refer to is roughly equivalent to the modern Standard Poodle variety.  It is claimed it was known in Germany from the Middle Ages, and it was Germany's water dog, just as England had the English Water Spaniel, France the Barbet, Ireland the Irish Water Spaniel and the Netherlands the Wetterhoun. Among the evidence used to support this theory is the indisputably Germanic name for the breed, Poodle or \"Pudel\" in German, which is derived from the Low German word \"puddeln\", which means \"to splash\". Additionally, there exists a number of artistic works, by various German artists, and from as early as the 17th century, that depict dogs of recognisably Poodle type. Some cynologists believe the Poodle originated in France, where it is known as the \"Caniche\" (French for \"duck dog\"), and that the breed descends from the Barbet. This view is shared by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI). Others argue that the breed originated in Russia, Piedmont or Northwest Africa.Whatever the Poodle's country of origin, both their German and French breed names indicate the modern Poodle's ancestors were widely used by waterfowlers both to retrieve shot game and to recover lost arrows and bolts that had missed their mark. The breed's distinctive lion coat clip developed as a practicality when they were used as waterfowler's dogs, with the long hair around the chest providing insulation for the dog's vitals in freezing water, while the shorn hindquarters reduced drag whilst swimming and the tufts of hair on the legs provided purchase in the water.,Due to their intelligence, obedient natures, athleticism and looks the Poodle was frequently employed in circuses, particularly in France. It was in French circuses that the breed was selectively bred down in size to create what is now known as the Miniature Poodle, which was until 1907 known as the Toy Poodle, as a smaller sized dog is easier to handle and transport in a travelling circus. As circus performers the variety was frequently seen performing all manner of tricks including walking tightropes, acting out comedies and even performing magic and card tricks. Outside of the circus the variety was to become an extremely popular companion dog.,The Toy Poodle was created at the beginning of the 20th century when breeders again bred the Miniature Poodle down in size to create a popular companion dog. Initially, these efforts were not entirely effective, and disfigured or misshapen pups, as well as pups with behavioural problems, were seen frequently, as a result of irresponsible breeding for dwarfed size only. As time progressed, and new breeding practices were adopted, the variety became set as a toy sized replica of the original. Later attempts to create an even smaller variety, the Teacup Poodle, were unable to overcome serious genetic abnormalities and were abandoned.The last of the Poodle varieties to be recognised was the Medium Poodle, which in size is mid way in between the Standard and the Miniature Poodle. Not universally recognised by the world's kennel clubs as a variety, the Medium Poodle is recognised by the FCI and most Continental European kennel clubs. One of the reasons for creating this fourth size variety is believed to be a desire to reduce the number of entries of Poodles by variety at conformation shows." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c512" }, "breed": "Portuguese Podengo", "origin": "Portugal", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Podengo", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Evitarocks.jpg/220px-Evitarocks.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6e4" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/portuguese_podengo.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 5, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 3, "energy": 4, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 15, "max_height_male": 28, "max_height_female": 28, "max_weight_male": 66, "max_weight_female": 66, "min_height_male": 22, "min_height_female": 22, "min_weight_male": 44, "min_weight_female": 44, "breed": "Portuguese Podengo" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f6c" }, "breed": "Portuguese Podengo", "contenido": "The Portuguese Podengo, also known as the Podengo Portugu\u00eas or Portuguese Warren Hound, is hound (sight and scent) breed from Portugal.

According to the Clube Portugu\u00eas de Canicultura's breed standard states the Large stands 55 to 70 centimetres (22 to 28 in) at the withers and healthy adults weigh 20 to 30 kilograms (44 to 66 lb), the Medium stands 40 to 54 centimetres (16 to 21 in) at the withers and healthy adults weigh 16 to 20 kilograms (35 to 44 lb), and the Small stands 20 to 30 centimetres (7.9 to 11.8 in) at the withers and healthy adults weigh 4 to 6 kilograms (8.8 to 13.2 lb).,The Grande (large) was developed for deer and wild boar hunting. It will exhaust and hold down the prey and await the hunter's gun. The Grande is now very rare in its home country.The Medio (medium) was developed for rabbit chasing, flushing, hunting and retrieval. Its hunting style includes catlike stalking and, similar to the Ibizan Hound, it often jumps above the prey before landing on or near it to flush it out of dense brush, rock crevices or burrows. It will dig if necessary to flush prey.The Pequeno (small) was also developed for flushing rabbits from cover. It is also a good mouser." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c519" }, "breed": "Pug", "origin": "China (Ming dynasty)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pug", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Mops_oct09_cropped2.jpg/220px-Mops_oct09_cropped2.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6e9" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/pug.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 4, "shedding": 4, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 5, "playfulness": 5, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 4, "energy": 3, "barking": 1, "min_life_expectancy": 13, "max_life_expectancy": 15, "max_height_male": 13, "max_height_female": 13, "max_weight_male": 18, "max_weight_female": 18, "min_height_male": 10, "min_height_female": 10, "min_weight_male": 14, "min_weight_female": 14, "breed": "Pug" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f73" }, "breed": "Pug", "contenido": "The pug is a breed of dog originally from China, with physically distinctive features of a wrinkly, short-muzzled face and curled tail. The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a variety of colors, most often light brown (fawn) or black, and a compact, square body with well-developed muscles.,Pugs were brought from China to Europe in the sixteenth century and were popularized in Western Europe by the House of Orange of the Netherlands, and the House of Stuart. In the United Kingdom, in the nineteenth century, Queen Victoria developed a passion for pugs which she passed on to other members of the Royal family.,Pugs are known for being sociable and gentle companion dogs. The American Kennel Club describes the breed's personality as \"even-tempered and charming\". Pugs remain popular into the twenty-first century, with some famous celebrity owners.,While the pugs that are depicted in eighteenth century prints tend to be long and lean, modern breed preferences are for a square cobby body, a compact form, a deep chest, and well-developed muscle. Their smooth and glossy coats can be fawn, apricot fawn, silver fawn, or black. The markings are clearly defined and there is a trace of a black line extending from the occiput to the tail. The tail normally curls tightly over the hip.Pugs have two distinct shapes for their ears, \"rose\" and \"button\". \"Rose\" ears are smaller than the standard style of \"button\" ears, and are folded with the front edge against the side of the head. Breeding preference goes to \"button\" style ears.Pugs' legs are strong, straight, of moderate length and are set well under. Their shoulders are moderately laid back. Their ankles are strong, their feet are small, their toes are well split-up, and their nails are black. The lower teeth normally protrude further than their upper, resulting in an under-bite.,This breed is often described by the Latin phrase multum in parvo, or \"much in little\" or \"a lot of dog in a small space\", alluding to the pug's remarkable and charming personality, despite its small size. Pugs are strong willed but rarely aggressive, and are suitable for families with children. The majority of the breed is very fond of children and sturdy enough to properly play with them. Depending on their owner's mood, they can be quiet and docile but also vivacious and teasing. Pugs tend to be intuitive and sensitive to the moods of their owners and are usually eager to please them. Pugs are playful and thrive on human companionship. They also tend to have a snoozy nature and spend a lot of time napping. Pugs are often called \"shadows\" because they follow their owners around and like to stay close to the action, craving attention and affection from their owners." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c51a" }, "breed": "Puli", "origin": "Hungary", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puli_dog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/PuliBlack_wb.jpg/220px-PuliBlack_wb.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6ea" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/puli.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 1, "grooming": 5, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 5, "trainability": 5, "energy": 3, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 15, "max_height_male": 17, "max_height_female": 17, "max_weight_male": 35, "max_weight_female": 35, "min_height_male": 17, "min_height_female": 17, "min_weight_male": 25, "min_weight_female": 25, "breed": "Puli" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f74" }, "breed": "Puli", "contenido": "The Puli is a small-medium breed of Hungarian herding and livestock guarding dog known for its long, corded coat. The tight curls of the coat appear similar to dreadlocks.

Other less common coat colors are white, gray, or cream (off-white or fak\u00f3 in Hungarian). A variety of the cream-coated dogs have black masks. The white Pulis are not albino, nor do they have blue eyes. They commonly have dark pigment, black pads, black noses and black pigment inside the mouth. The white gene is recessive to the pure black gene. The breed standard for females is about 16.5 inches (42 cm) at the withers and 17 inches for males.  Females weigh 23-25 pounds and males slightly more. The coat of some Puli dogs can be different with either thinner or thicker cords which can be flat or round depending on the texture of the coat and the balance of undercoat to outer coat.The coat is the result of a controlled matting process. Thin, rope-like corded coats are desired and the grooming should control the coat towards the forming of thinner ropes. The Puli's coat needs considerable grooming to keep its cords clean, neat, and attractive. With age, the coat can become quite long, even reaching the ground. Alternatively, the coat can be trimmed short regularly for easy maintenance although the corded coat is what attracts many people to the breed. Contrary to some beliefs, the coat of a healthy puli will grow out again after trimming. This breed has little to no shedding.,The Puli is an intelligent and active dog. It needs obedience training while still young. If a Puli gets enough exercise, it can live in the city,,but they do best when not kept indoor pets in small living spaces. Pulis kept indoors need a lot of exercise to use up their energy, or they can become either shy or overactive. They need to get the kind of exercise they were created for.

It is found herding flocks of sheep throughout the Pyrenees alongside the much larger Pyrenean Mountain Dog which is kept as a flock guardian.,The Pyrenean Sheepdog is found in three coat types, the long-haired and goat-haired (together called the Chien de Berger des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es \u00c0 Poil Long) as well as the smooth-faced (called the Chien de Berger des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es \u00c0 Face Rase); the latter is recognised as a separate breed from the former two by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Centrale Canine.,The Pyrenean Sheepdog is found along the entire length of the French Pyrenees and is even known in Basque Country to the west. The breed is one of a number of similar rough-coated sheep herding-type breeds found throughout Europe including the Briard and Berger Picard from France, the Barbado da Terceira and Cao da Serra de Aires from the Azores and Portugal, the Polish Lowland Sheepdog from Poland, the Gos d'atura from Catalonia, the Pastore Fonnese from Sardinia, the Bearded Collie, Border Collie, Rough Collie and extinct Welsh Hillman from Britain, the Schafpudel from Germany, and the Schapendoes from Holland, as well as the Armant from Egypt (descended from French Briards). A number of scholars believe it is possible the ancestors of these herding-type dogs were introduced to Europe during Indo-European migrations over 4,000 years ago, and they spread throughout the continent evolving through selective breeding into the regional breeds with certain physical characteristics to suit the demands or preferences of the region.Traditionally the Pyrenean Sheepdog is one of two breeds maintained by shepherds in the Pyrenees, the larger Pyrenean Mountain Dog was used as a flock guardian, protecting flocks from depredation from local predators (in particular wolves), as well as from thieves; the smaller Pyrenean Sheepdog was used to herd the flocks, an important function over the summer months when the flocks are grazed on mountain pastures.The Pyrenean Sheepdog was first recognised by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Centrale Canine in 1926; today they recognise it as two breeds, the first the long-haired or Chien de Berger des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es \u00c0 Poil Long and the second the smooth-faced or Chien de Berger des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es \u00c0 Face Rase.The Pyrenean Sheepdog is still used as a herding dog in the Pyrenees region, in France the breed is sometimes called the Labrit or Labri or the Berger des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, it is often referred to as the Petit Berger which means Little Shepherd.,The Pyrenean Sheepdog is a small to medium-sized breed (it is the smallest French herding breed) that resembles as small Berger Picard; they usually stand between 38 and 56 centimetres (15 and 22 in); the breed standards state the long-haired dogs are 40 to 50 centimetres (16 to 20 in) and bitches 38 to 48 centimetres (15 to 19 in) whilst smooth-faced dogs are 40 to 54 centimetres (16 to 21 in) and bitches 40\u201352 centimetres (16\u201320 in). The breed weighs between 8 and 15 kilograms (18 and 33 lb). The breed has a lean, athletic build which gives them both speed and endurance as is typical of smaller herding dogs; the varieties are anatomically almost identical, although the smooth-faced variety is described as being slightly shorter in the body and having more compact feet. The breed is considered very hardy and its build gives it impressive stamina, particularly so given the altitudes it works in, it easily covers over 32 kilometres (20 mi) in a day.The Pyrenean Sheepdog's coat can be medium (known as goat-haired) or long, the long-haired varieties have longer hair on the face whilst the smooth-faced variety has much shorter hair on its face. The breed's coat provides excellent protection from extreme weather, particularly the long-haired variety, the variations seen in the breed's coats is an indication that the breed is primarily bred for working ability and not appearance. The breed can be fawn, grey, blue, brindle or black in colour which can be overlaid with black and also can have some white on the chest and limbs.Traditionally the Pyrenean Sheepdog's ears and tail were docked although this custom is no longer common due to the procedures being restricted/ banned in numerous countries." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c520" }, "breed": "Rafeiro do Alentejo", "origin": "Portugal", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafeiro_do_Alentejo", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Rafeiro_male.jpg/220px-Rafeiro_male.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6ed" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/rafeiro_do_alentejo.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 3, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 5, "trainability": 5, "energy": 3, "barking": 2, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 14, "max_height_male": 29, "max_height_female": 29, "max_weight_male": 132, "max_weight_female": 132, "min_height_male": 25, "min_height_female": 25, "min_weight_male": 77, "min_weight_female": 77, "breed": "Rafeiro do Alentejo" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f7b" }, "breed": "Rafeiro do Alentejo", "contenido": "The Rafeiro do Alentejo is a Portuguese breed of livestock guardian dog.

The colour is typically a red shade with white, or a mahogany brindle with white. Black shading is usually found on the face and ears. The tail is long and heavy, hanging high. The eyes are usually brown, but sometimes can be icy blue, and should have naturally tight lids, with haws only slightly visible.,The earliest written records of the St. Bernard are from monks at the Great St Bernard Hospice at the Great St Bernard Pass in 1707, with paintings and drawings of the dog dating even earlier. Early British accounts of the breed described the breed as the Alpine Spaniel.

Through the efforts of Father Robert Billard, the breed was resurrected during the second half of the 20th century; its national breed club was founded in 1990. The breed was recognised by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Centrale Canine (French Kennel Club) in 2003.,The history of this breed can be traced to the 16th century, however by the mid 20th century it had nearly become extinct. Following World War II, Robert Billard, a priest, was given a parish in Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire in the Bresse region of France. Billard was an active hunter and began to search for a suitable hunting dog. He was told of a local dog breed known as the \"Epagneul de Saint-Usuge\", and contacted the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Centrale Canine in order to find what happened to the breed.Father Billard found that the last recording of the Saint-Usuge Spaniel was in a dog show in 1936 in the nearby town of Louhans, and he located  the breed standard from that show. He proceeded to visit the hunters in his parish until he found a dog which matched the breed description, a female named Poupette.In 1950 he found a male spaniel named Dick, who was a son of Braco, the dog which won best in show at the show in 1936. He continued to find other male dogs around the region to include in the reconstruction of the breed. In 1962, a Small M\u00fcnsterl\u00e4nder female named Bianca von der Rumerburg was used in the breeding programme, chosen as that breed's standards mostly closely resemble the Saint-Usuge's. In 1980, the work on reconstructing the breed was handed over to Serge Bey, a local conservationist. Father Billard's breeding programme bred nearly 250 dogs over a 33-year period.The national breed club for France was set up in 1990 and known as the Club de l'Epagneul de Saint-Usuge. The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Centrale Canine recognised the Saint Usuge Spaniel on January 8, 2003, placing it within Group 7 with other continental spaniels. While the breed is not fully recognised by the American Kennel Club,  it is listed as a breed in the club's companion animal recovery scheme.,It is a small French pointing breed, measuring 16\u201321 inches (41\u201353 cm) at the withers according to the breed standard. They have a typical spaniel appearance, with ears that are located below the eyeline that have fringes long enough to reach the tip of the nose. The body should be well muscled with a broad, deep chest. The only color that the coat comes in is brown, but it may have white markings including a white \"star\" on the forehead, which some dogs can lose as their adult coat grows in. In addition to the ears; the tail, shoulders and chest should also be fringed with fur. The tail of the Saint Usuge is never docked, and should be long and curved.,Described by its French breed club as easy to train, it is an obedient, passionate and affectionate breed.

The short-haired breed is approximately 2 cm smaller, with weights in the same range.It shares certain physical characteristics with both scent hounds and sight hounds. It has long legs, tucked-up loins and a roached (slightly convex) back more typical of a sight hound. The head has many scent hound features including low-set pendulous ears although it has a long, tapering muzzle with thin lips that are not pendulous. The tail is long and tapered, and is typically carried high when hunting enabling them to be spotted easily when hunting.,Traditionally kept as pack hounds, the Segugio Italiano is very stubborn; once on a scent trail they display a single-minded dedication to following it, much like the Bloodhound, although unlike the latter the Segugio Italiano also captures and kills game." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c540" }, "breed": "Serbian Hound", "origin": "Serbia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_Hound", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Serbian_Hound.JPG/220px-Serbian_Hound.JPG", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fa7" }, "breed": "Serbian Hound", "contenido": "The Serbian Hound (Serbo-Croatian: srpski goni\u010d / \u0441\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0433\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0447), previously known as the Balkan Hound (Serbo-Croatian: balkanski goni\u010d / \u0431\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0433\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0447), is a breed of scent hound from Serbia.,The Serbian Hound is a medium sized hound breed, the breed standard states dogs should stand between 46 and 56 centimetres (18 and 22 in) with bitches being slightly smaller, standing between 44 and 54 centimetres (17 and 21 in), and they typically weigh around 20 kilograms (44 lb).

The breed was developed in Australia, although the ancestral types and breeds were from Great Britain. It is closely related to the Australian Terrier and the Yorkshire Terrier. The breed is called the Silky Terrier in North America, but is called the Australian Silky Terrier in its country of origin and in the rest of the world.,The Australian Silky Terrier is a small and compact short-legged terrier, 23 to 26 cm (9.1 to 10.2 in) at the withers, alert and active. The long silky grey and white or blue and tan coat is an identifying feature, hanging straight and parted along the back, and described as \"flat, fine and glossy\". All proportions and aspects of the body and head as well as desirable shades of grey and white and placement of markings are extensively described in the breed standard.The Silky Terrier should be slightly longer than tall (about one fifth longer than the height at withers). This is a dog that was historically used for hunting and killing rodents and snakes, so its body should have enough substance to fit this role. The coat requires quite a lot of regular grooming and shampooing to retain its silkiness.,The Silky Terrier has a strong, wedge-shaped head. The eyes are small and almond-shaped. According to the standards, light-colored eyes are considered a fault. The ears are small and carried erect. The Silky Terrier has a high-set tail and small, almost catlike, feet. The coat should be long, but not so long AS to approach floor length. The hair on the face and ears is normally cut.,The ancestors of the Australian Silky Terrier include the Yorkshire Terrier and the Australian Terrier (which descends from the rough coated type terriers brought from Great Britain to Australia in the early 19th century); few records indicate whether early dogs were just Australian Terriers born with silky fur, or whether there was an attempt to create a separate breed. According to the American Kennel Club, the breed was created at the end of the 19th century when Yorkshire Terriers were crossed with Australian Terriers. At first the breed was known as the Sydney Silky, as it was found primarily in the city of Sydney, Australia. Although most other Australian breeds were working dogs, the Silky Terrier was bred primarily to be an urban pet and companion, although it is also known for killing snakes in Australia.Up until 1929 the Australian Terrier, the Australian Silky Terrier, and the Yorkshire Terrier were not clearly defined. Dogs of three different breeds might be born in the same litter, to be separated by appearance into the different types once they were grown. After 1932 in Australia, further crossbreeding was discouraged, and in 1955 the breed's name officially became the Australian Silky Terrier. The breed was recognised by the Australian National Kennel Council in 1958 in the Toy Group.During and after World War II American servicemen who had been stationed in Australia brought back to the United States a few Silky Terriers. Newspaper photographs of the breed in 1954 caused an upsurge of popularity and hundreds of Silkies were imported from Australia to the United States. The American Kennel Club recognised the breed as the Silky Terrier in 1959, as did the United Kennel Club (US) in 1965 where it is shown as a Terrier; it is also recognised as the Silky Terrier by the Canadian Kennel Club. The breed is recognised by all the major kennel clubs in the English speaking world, and internationally by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale as breed number 236.

Wheatens typically have one of two coat types: Irish or Heavy (American). The Irish coat is generally silkier and wavier than the Heavy, or American coat, which is thicker and fuller. Wheatens are generally friendly and playful, and tend to get along well with children and other dogs.,The Wheaten was bred in Ireland for over two hundred years to be an all-purpose farm dog whose duties included herding, watching and guarding livestock, and vermin hunting and killing. They share a common ancestry with the Kerry Blue Terrier and the Irish Terrier but were not owned by gentry. In Ireland, they were commonly referred to as the \"Poor Man's Wolfhound.\"  Their tails used to be docked to avoid taxes and were often kept to a specific size.Despite its long history, the Wheaten was not recognized as a breed in Ireland by the Irish Kennel Club until 1937. In 1943, the British Kennel Club recognized the breed in the UK as well. The first Wheatens were exported to Lydia Vogel in the United States in the 1940s, but serious interest in the breed took another ten years to develop. The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier Club of America, Inc. was established in 1962, seven years after the formation of The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier Club of Great Britain. In the 1970s, the first Wheatens were imported into Australia by Anubis Kennels. In 1973, they were recognized by the American Kennel Club. The recent importation of Irish-style dogs has improved and broadened the gene pool. The American Herding Breed Association (AHBA) accepted the Wheaten in the 1990s at which point members of the breed were allowed to participate in its herding capability tests and trials. Today, Wheatens compete in obedience, agility, and tracking and are occasionally used in animal-assisted therapy as well. The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier Club of America, Inc. (SCWTCA, Inc.)  is a member of the American Kennel Club which protects and advances the interests of the breed and guards against commercial exploitation. It serves breeders, owners, competition organizers and prospective owners.,Puppies have dark coats of red, brown, mahogany or white. Their muzzles and ears may be black or dark brown. The reddish-brown puppy coat gradually grows out to nearly white before maturing into a wheaten-colored coat as they get older. The adult coat typically matures by 3 years old and may contain black, white, or darker brown \"guard\" hairs in addition to the lighter wheaten colored hair.  If adults ever have skin injuries, the resulting hair growth (wound hair) will be the dark color of their puppy coat before it eventually grows out to the wheat color. It may also come out to a molten chocolate color, either white or milky colored fur .The Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier is a medium-sized dog, which ranges on average from 17 to 20 inches (43 to 51 cm) in height and about 30 to 45 pounds (14 to 20 kg) in weight. The breed has a square structure and is well built. Their soft, silky hair does not shed like most dogs; like human hair and Poodle hair, it keeps growing; they do need trimming and should be brushed and combed once a day to avoid mats. They are very smart dogs, and are easy to train. They love people, and they rarely have aggression issues if obtained from a reputable breeder.,The Irish coat tends to be thinner and silkier than the American variety and it has a devoted following in Ireland and Europe.  Breeders of the pure Irish type believe this is the original working coat. The coat is not thin \u2013 breeders of the Irish type consider the American heavy coat to be \"bouffant\", not that of the original working terrier type. There are a few breeders of the Irish type in the US and Canada.  In the AKC conformation show ring, the judges do not always accept the Irish type well.  The Irish is well received in the UK and Europe.  The \"Heavy Irish\" coat is usually a result of cross-breeding between coat types \u2013 American/English coat with an Irish type.  The Irish coat still requires daily brushing to stay free of matted hair.,The Wheatens seen in Ireland today are of the same size, shape, and coat texture as those seen and documented well over 100 years ago. Evidence of this can be seen from the famous artwork \"The Aran Fisherman's Drowned Child\" by the Irish painter Frederic William Burton." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c557" }, "breed": "Spanish Water Dog", "origin": "Andalusia (Spain)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Water_Dog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Perro_agua.jpg/220px-Perro_agua.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c706" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/spanish_water_dog.jpg", "good_with_children": 4, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 1, "grooming": 4, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 4, "energy": 4, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 14, "max_height_male": 19.75, "max_height_female": 19.75, "max_weight_male": 49, "max_weight_female": 40, "min_height_male": 17.5, "min_height_female": 17.5, "min_weight_male": 40, "min_weight_female": 31, "breed": "Spanish Water Dog" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fc3" }, "breed": "Spanish Water Dog", "contenido": "The Spanish Water Dog (perro de agua espa\u00f1ol) breed is used in Spain as a general purpose sheepdog and guard.

They are well-adapted to the uneven and thickly forested terrain of Taiwan, having become a semi-wild breed prior to the arrival of several colonial reigns and foreign powers. Notwithstanding these adaptations, Formosans retained the potential to be trained and are now used as hunting dogs, guard dogs, stunt dogs, rescue dogs, or simply as companions.  The Taiwan dog are classified into one medium type and two small types., There are two small types of the Formosan Mountain Dog; one is about 40 centimetres (16 in) tall at the shoulder and the other is around 30 centimetres (12 in). However, the latter one was not found during the research conducted by Dr. Sung Yung-yi (\u5b8b\u6c38\u7fa9) in 1976. The medium type of the Formosan Mountain Dog has a shoulder height under 50 centimetres (20 in), with a firm and fit body, slim waist, big chest and half-covered ears. The most common type of these three in recent years is the medium-sized dog. Its color can range from black to earthy yellow or yellowish-brown and the nose is black. Black coating on the tongue is one of the most distinguished traits of the Formosan Mountain Dog.Dr. Sung of the National Taiwan University and Mr. Ming Jie, Xu of the Formosan Dog & Guard Dogs Breeding Center (\u53f0\u7063\u72ac\u8b77\u885b\u72ac\u7e41\u6b96\u4e2d\u5fc3) described a typical Formosan as having almond eyes, firm jaw strength, black coating on the tongue, a triangular face, thin prick ears and a sickle tail. The tail is upright or curved with a thick fur coat, but the belly is hairless; the tail is used to warm the belly and may even be long enough to protect the snout from insects. The dog is also well known for being well-balanced.,Formosan dogs are particularly agile; they are known for their hopping skill, especially when they are hunting small animals, such as rats. When they are startled or trying to intimidate their target, they will hop sideways back and forth. Unlike Rottweilers and German Shepherds, Formosan dogs do not hold their bite on their target. This habit is adopted and may be traced back to early boar hunting. Taiwanese aborigines used five to six Formosan dogs to circle a wild boar and each dog would work to wound the boar. They would release their bite once they had attacked it and wait for the next attack again and again until the boar was exhausted enough for their master to move in for the final kill.,Proportions" }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c565" }, "breed": "Tamaskan Dog", "origin": "United Kingdom", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamaskan_Dog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/NImale.jpg/220px-NImale.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fd5" }, "breed": "Tamaskan Dog", "contenido": "The Northern Inuit Dog, along with its offshoot breed lines the Tamaskan dog, the British Timber dog and the Utonagan, is a breed of dog developed from a 1980s breeding project in the United Kingdom with the objective of producing a dog breed that resembles wolves.Northern Inuit Dogs descend from dogs of unknown breed ancestry imported from North America in the 1980s that were crossed with Alaskan Malamutes, German Shepherds, Siberian Huskies and possibly Samoyeds; the intention of the breeding project was to create a dog of wolf-like appearance that could be kept as a companion dog and that could also be trained for other tasks.The Northern Inuit Dog breeding project subsequently split into a number of breed lines, including the Tamaskan dog, the British Timber dog and the Utonagan.,Northern Inuit Dogs were used in the filming of the television series Game of Thrones to portray dire wolves.A Tamaskan dog played a wolf in a 2016 Broadway production of The Crucible.A Tamaskan has been the live mascot for the NC State Wolfpack since 2010, appearing on the sidelines of football games, bowl games, and other football and men\u2019s basketball events.,Siberian Husky" }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c56e" }, "breed": "Tibetan Spaniel", "origin": "Tibet", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Spaniel", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Tibetansk_spaniel.jpg/220px-Tibetansk_spaniel.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c712" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/tibetan_spaniel.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 4, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 4, "trainability": 3, "energy": 3, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 15, "max_height_male": 10, "max_height_female": 10, "max_weight_male": 15, "max_weight_female": 15, "min_height_male": 10, "min_height_female": 10, "min_weight_male": 9, "min_weight_female": 9, "breed": "Tibetan Spaniel" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fe0" }, "breed": "Tibetan Spaniel", "contenido": "The Tibetan Spaniel is a breed of assertive, small dogs originating in Tibet.

They are scent hounds that descended from the Celtic hounds in the late 1800s, mainly for their hunting skills. They are hardworking, passionate, and independent dogs not known for their size, but rather their intelligence. For that reason, hunters can regularly use these dogs to catch their prey, wounded or otherwise. Their ability to stretch over long distances, on rough hot or cold terrain for their prey is also another perk of keeping this dog by your side. Hunters do have to worry about injuries to their dog, however, along with the common injuries that these dogs obtain throughout their life, like hip dysplasia or ear infections. Barring any injuries, these dogs tend to live an energetic life for about 12-14 years, and tend to be an overall healthy and robust dog.,The Tyrolean Hound, also known as the Tyroler Bracke, is a breed of scent hound originally developed in the 1800s from the Bracke hounds and the Celtic hounds. It was first bred in Tyrol as a dog adapted to hunting in the snow. Emperor Maximilian I used this hound for hunting hare and fox and for tracking wounded game. Breeding began in 1860, and then in 1896 the first standard of breeding was published. Followed shortly thereafter, the Tyrolean Hound was recognized as their own breed in 1908. It was not until 2006, that the Tyrolean Hound was recognized by the United Kennel Club.As with dogs that come from hardworking scent hound breeds, the Tyrolean hound was bred for their hunting ability. The breed is known for their excellent ability in being able to maneuver through mountainous or heavily wooded areas, and for their amazing scenting skills. This is all made possible with the size of the Tyrolean Hound. It tends to be a medium to large dog, measuring in at about 18.5 to 24 inches tall, and weighing about 35 to 60 pounds for males. Females tend to be smaller physically, only growing to be about 16.5 to 19 inches tall, however, both have a nice flowing outline and tend to be fairly muscular. The Tyrolean Hound, whether male or female, also has a thick double coat, with a coarse undercoat, as opposed to fine. They also tend to have the 3 main colors of red, black, and tan, with patches of white mixed in between. ,The head of the Tyrolean Hound is fairly broad with a slight arch going down the middle. This arch continues into the deep and straight muzzle of the dog, ending down at either a black or brown nose, with black is more desirable.,The teeth of the Tyrolean Hound should be spaced, and it would be normal to notice that the dog is missing one or two premolars.

Early Weimaraners were used by royalty for hunting large game such as boar, bear and deer. As the popularity of large game hunting began to decline, Weimaraners were used for hunting smaller animals like fowl, rabbits and foxes.,The Weimaraner is an all-purpose gun dog. The name comes from the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Karl August, whose court, located in the city of Weimar (now in the state of Thuringia in modern-day Germany), enjoyed hunting. The Weimaraner possesses traits such as speed, stamina, great sense of smell, great eyes, courage, and intelligence. The breed is sometimes referred to as the \"gray ghost\" of the dog world originating from its ghostly coat and eye color along with its stealthy hunting style.,The Weimaraner was kept in the Weimar court in the 19th century and carried a good deal of Leithound ancestry. Two theories propose that they descended from the Chien-gris dogs, or the St. Hubert Hound whose descendant is the Bloodhound. In the beginning, Germany's Grand Duke Karl August used the Weimaraner to hunt big-game like wolves, bears, and mountain lions, but as Europe's number of big-game decreased, the Weimaraner turned into a point and retrieve hunter of small game. The breed arrived to America in the late 1920s, and its popularity increased in the 1950s. The breed became popular due to celebrities like Grace Kelly, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Dick Clark. The famous artist and photographer William Wegman increased the breed's popularity even more with his world famous Weimaraner portraits and video segments.,The Weimaraner is athletic in appearance. Traditionally, the tail is docked. In countries where this is still carried out, the docked tail should measure approximately 6 inches in the adult dog, and this is part of the American Kennel Club breed standard.  Tail docking is illegal in several countries, where the breed is shown with an entire tail. The British Kennel Club breed standard describes a tail reaching to the hocks and carried below the level of the back when relaxed, and the German breed club standard calls for a full tail that is strong and well coated, which can be carried above the line of the back when the dog is working.

They are a sighthound breed that originated in England, where they descended from the Greyhound. Whippets today still strongly resemble a smaller Greyhound. Part of the hound group, Whippets have relatively few health problems other than arrhythmia. Whippets also participate in dog sports such as lure coursing, agility, dock diving and flyball. The name is derived from an early-17th-century word, now obsolete, meaning \"to move briskly\".There has been continuity in describing Greyhound-types of different sizes: large, medium and small, as recorded in hunting manuals and works on natural history from the Middle Ages. Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York confirmed in his early-15th-century translation and additions to the original late 14th century French Livre de chasse the advantage of maintaining the great, the middle, and the small size of greyhound for different sorts of game. The English physician and academic John Caius refers in his 16th century De Canibus Britannicus to lesser as well as greater sorts of Leporarius, Grehounde (greyhound) and notably to a type which has been connected to the Whippet, the Tumbler, a lesser sort of mungrell Greyhounde and excellent warren dog for catching rabbits, also recorded by the early-19th-century Scottish curator and editor Thomas Brown. The Victorian English writers describe the emerging modern breed of Whippet or snap-dog bred for catching rabbits, coursing competitions, straight rag-racing, and for the novel show fancy.This has led to Whippets being described as \"the poor man's greyhound\". They are a popular companion breed frequently used in amateur racing, lure coursing, and dog shows; they have the highest running speed of breeds for their weight: and are possibly the fastest accelerating dog breed.,Whippets were bred to hunt by sight, coursing game in open areas at high speeds. There are numerous representations of small greyhound-like hounds in art dating back to Ancient Egyptian times. In medieval England, a small Greyhound breed became popular for use as a ratting dog; the first written English use of the word Whippet with regard to a type of dog was in 1610. ,Whippets were commonly known as \"snap dogs\" for their tendency to \"snap up\" nearby prey. In the picture by Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1686\u20131755) of two dogs presented to Louis XV, they are either Whippets or small Greyhounds, but are probably related to an early form of Whippet. Oudry also painted a second painting of Misse with a different, non-sighthound dog. There is a 1758 painting by Pompeo Batoni entitled Portrait of Charles Compton, 7th Earl of Northampton which features a similar whippet-like dog.In the 19th century, Whippet racing was a popular sport in parts of England. The Whippet was held in high regard in the northern parts of England and Wales, but was generally disregarded in the rest of the country. At the time, there were two varieties of Whippet. The first type had a smooth coat, was more popular in Lancashire, Yorkshire, and the Midlands, and became the modern Whippet. The other had a rough coat from crossbreeding with Bedlington Terriers. This type was more popular in Durham and Northumberland and was frequently referred to as a \"rabbit dog\". Early specimens were taken from the race track by the dog fanciers of the time and exported around the world. John Taylor said that \"In all the shapes and forms of dogges; of all which there are but two sorts that are useful to man's profits, which two are the mastiffe and the little curre, whippet, or house-dogge; all the rest are for pleasure and recreation.\"The age of the modern Whippet dawned in 1891 when The Kennel Club granted the breed official recognition, thus making the Whippet eligible for competition in dog shows, and commencing the recording of their pedigrees. In the United States, the Whippet was recognised in 1888 by the American Kennel Club. Whippets arrived in the United States with mill operators from England, and the first populations were established in Massachusetts. The Whippet is the 55th most popular breed according to the American Kennel Club.In 1964, Ch. Courtenay Fleetfoot of Pennyworth won best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. In 1992, Pencloe Dutch Gold won best in show at Crufts, a Whippet known as Cobyco Call the Tune won in 2004 and in 2018 the award was achieved by Ch Collooney Tartan Tease. In 2011, GCh. Starline's Chanel, a female Whippet, was chosen as the hound Show Dog of the Year by the Westminster Kennel Club.,Dog racing was originally an extension of hare coursing. Whippets began to be bred to race in the mid-nineteenth century. The first form of the sport was a rudimentary form of coursing known as 'ragging', and dogs who participated were said to be 'trained to the rag'. Dogs were kept on a leash by a person known as a slip, who was frequently also the race judge. The slip would release the dogs from their collars at the same time, and they would race towards their owners, who were standing at the opposite end of the track waving towels.Whippet rags were a popular Sunday event in the north and Midlands at the time. There were also international events; in Australia, at a track known as Gurney's Paddock, there were races of more than 300 whippets every Saturday, and three nights a week at the White City track. Eventually, the sport evolved and dogs were divided into four groups: those who hunted rabbits, which was not governed by rules; those who coursed hare, for which a set of rules was established; those trained to the rag; and those trained to chase a mechanical lure in a fashion similar to Greyhound races. Few of the Whippets if any of the four types were purebred, as maintaining a purebred bloodline was not considered as important as breeding dogs that could win races. Many racing dogs were part Terrier, part Greyhound, or part Lurcher.In 1967, the British Whippet Racing Association was established to bring around reform and consistency in race rules and procedures for races involving non-purebred Whippets. A year later, viewing the non-purebred dogs as a threat, the Whippet Club Racing Association was established exclusively for purebred animals." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c586" }, "breed": "White Shepherd", "origin": "United States", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Shepherd", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Kandestack_62406.jpg/220px-Kandestack_62406.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd6001" }, "breed": "White Shepherd", "contenido": "The White Shepherd also known as the \"White Swiss Shepherd\" is the predecessor of the German Shepherd, with origins dating back the Thuringian shepherds.

On Dartbrook Station, in the Upper Hunter Valley, Hall selectively crossed the offspring of Northumberland Drover's Dogs (Border Collie lineage) that he had imported, with the progeny of dingoes that he had tamed. By 1840 he had bred the type of dog that he needed to control cattle on the massive runs that his family owned, and until he died in 1870 few of these dogs were owned and used by anyone outside the Hall family and their workers. However the death of Thomas Hall and the break-up of the Hall estate coincided with the development of the dog show, and an interest in breeding dogs to specific criteria or standards. The Halls Heeler was further developed into two contemporary dog breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog.,George Hall and his family arrived in the New South Wales Colony in 1802. By 1825, George's son Thomas Simpson Hall and some of his older brothers had established two cattle stations in the Hunter Region, Gundebri near the present day Merriwa, and Dartbrook near Aberdeen. In the 1828 census Thomas Hall is described as 20 years old, and the manager of Dartbrook. Using this property as a home base, Hall began a northward expansion into the Liverpool Plains, New England and Queensland, setting up properties for the family and eventually controlling over 1 million acres of good grazing land.On Dartbrook Thomas Hall set about breeding the cattle needed to stock these extensive holdings, and developed a herd of polled shorthorn cattle from stock imported from Durham in 1830. Getting the cattle to the Sydney markets presented a problem in that thousands of head of cattle had to be moved for thousands of kilometres along unfenced stock routes through sometimes rugged bush and mountain ranges.  A note, in his own writing, records Thomas Hall's anger at losing 200 head in scrub. A droving dog was desperately needed but the colonial working dogs are understood to have been of Old English Sheepdog type (commonly referred to as Smithfields; descendants of these dogs still exist) useful only over short distances and for yard work with domesticated cattle. Thomas Hall addressed the problem by importing several of the dogs used by drovers in Northumberland, his parents\u2019 home county. At this time dogs were generally described by their job, regardless of whether they constituted a \u2018breed\u2019 as it is currently understood, and in the manner of the time these blue mottled dogs were known as the Northumberland Blue Merle Drovers Dog.Thomas Hall crossed his Drovers Dogs with dingoes that he had tamed and then continued to selectively crossbreed until 1840, when he was satisfied with his resultant breed. This working cattle dog was so suited to the Hall's needs that no breed changes were considered necessary by Thomas for the rest of his life. During the next 30 years, the Halls Heelers, as they became known, were used only by the Halls and those who worked for them. Given that they were dependent on the dogs, which gave them an advantage over other cattle breeders, it is understandable that the dogs were not distributed beyond the Halls' properties. It was not until after Thomas Hall's death in 1870, when the properties went to auction with the stock on them that Halls Heelers became freely available.Jack Timmins was a contract drover working in the Upper Hunter Valley and was employed by the Hall family to take cattle to the Sydney markets. In the late 1840s he obtained a pair of Halls Heelers, from which he bred a line of dogs that he described as \"great biters\", a characteristic which led to the dogs being called Timmins Biters. Robert Kaleski referred to them as \"wonderful workers\" in an article titled The Working Dogs of Australia in 1911. Other Hall associates, particularly those on properties distant from Dartbrook near the Queensland border, were also breeding their own dogs from Halls Heeler stock.In 1976 a monument to Thomas Hall's achievement was erected on Dartbrook Road at the Blue Heeler Bridge in Dartbrook, New South Wales. The plaque inscription says: \"This plaque presented by The Australian Cattle Society of NSW commemorates Thomas S. Hall of Dartbrook who in 1840 in this area carried out his breeding experiments with the native dog the dingo and a pair of smooth coated blue merle collies. These dogs known as Halls Heelers became the foundation of today's breed the Australian Cattle Dog.\",While dogs were not routinely bred for consistent appearance before the end of the 19th century, the Halls Heeler was described as a thick-set dingo, usually speckled blue or red in appearance.,By the 1890s, the dogs had attracted the attention of the Cattle Dog Club of Sydney, a group of men with a recreational interest in the new practice of showing dogs competitively. They reportedly adopted the term Australian Cattle Dog to refer to the dogs being bred from bloodlines originating from Thomas Hall's \"heelers\", and prominent members of the group concentrated on breeding these lines. Of these breeders, the Bagust family was the most influential.  Robert Kaleski, of Moorebank, at the time a young associate of Harry Bagust, noted that in 1893 cattle dog breeders had begun to \"fix the type\" so he drew up a standard for them on those lines.Selective breeding of those dogs that were born bob-tailed or without tails from some point in the late 19th century led to the development of the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog. The Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog is recognised by the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog Club of New South Wales and by the Australian National Kennel Council in the Working Dogs Group, and it was provisionally accepted by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 2005, in Group 1, Section 2 : Cattle Dogs (except Swiss Cattle Dogs) as breed number 351." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5a6" }, "breed": "Hawaiian Poi Dog", "origin": "Hawaii (United States)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_Poi_Dog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Hawaiian_natives_wearing_kihei%2C_with_animals%2C_sketch_by_Louis_Choris_%28crop%2C_central_dog%29.jpg/220px-Hawaiian_natives_wearing_kihei%2C_with_animals%2C_sketch_by_Louis_Choris_%28crop%2C_central_dog%29.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ed7" }, "breed": "Hawaiian Poi Dog", "contenido": "The Hawaiian Poi Dog (Hawaiian: \u02bb\u012blio or \u02bb\u012blio m\u0101ku\u02bbe) is an extinct breed of pariah dog from Hawai\u02bbi which was used by Native Hawaiians as a spiritual protector of children and as a source of food.,The original Hawaiian poi dog were descended from the Polynesian dogs brought to the Hawaiian Islands by the Polynesian people. Genetic studies on the New Zealand Kur\u012b dog indicate that the origin of this dog (and therefore probably the Hawaiian dog) is Indonesia. Referred as the \u02bb\u012blio in the Hawaiian language, the modern name of this breed is derived from poi, a Hawaiian staple food made from kalo or taro root. Poi was used to fatten the dogs for use as food because meat was too valuable to be used as dog food. Since the Hawaiian Islands did not have large land mammals other than feral hogs, Poi dogs were not needed for hunting. The dogs were never deliberately bred to a standard, but human and natural selection still came into play.,European explorers like Captain Cook encountered pot-bellied, short-legged poi dogs that freely associated with hogs in the village. The dogs had very short hair that could come in any color, but brown poi dogs were regarded as distinct enough to warrant a specific name. The dogs also had peculiarly flattened heads. The latter trait is sometimes ascribed to the diet of the dogs in some unspecified way. Considering that poi does not require chewing, the dogs might have lost the need to maintain strong temporalis muscles; a reduced temporal fossa will cause a dog's head to appear flattened. Poi dogs were considered rather dim-witted and sluggish \u2013 any good hunting dog with acute senses would neither make a good poi dog nor be particularly useful on the islands \u2013 however, the dogs were strong-willed and not easily commanded.The poi dog was a two-purpose breed \u2013 used for food and as a lucky charm. Unsuited for anything else, the breed declined to extinction as the native religion was abandoned and eating dog meat became unfashionable. Feral dogs of European settlers interbred with the poi dogs, and by the early 20th century at latest, the breed disappeared as a distinct entity.,No surviving artwork or photograph from Hawaiian history are authentically attributed as poi dogs. Often Western artists infused Euro-American characteristics in their 18th-century depictions of the dogs of Polynesia and by the 19th century, the dogs being depicted were of foreign breeds. The lack of details has led historians to guess at what works may be realistic depictions of the breed based on the physical characteristics.Writers Katharine Luomala and Margaret Titcomb both agreed an unfinished line drawing, dated to c. 1816\u201317, by French artist Louis Choris, who was part of the exploring expedition of Otto von Kotzebue, may show one of the dogs in center which may resemble the extinct breed. Luomala also claims French artist Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Lauvergne possibly captured a dog with the same traits in his colored drawing of Honolulu Harbor in 1836.Ancient Hawaiian petroglyphs also depict simplified representation of the dogs. They often show the curl tails and pointed ears characteristics of the breed." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5ab" }, "breed": "Norfolk Spaniel", "origin": "United Kingdom", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Spaniel", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Dash-II-Norfolk-Spaniel.jpg/220px-Dash-II-Norfolk-Spaniel.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f35" }, "breed": "Norfolk Spaniel", "contenido": "The Norfolk Spaniel or Shropshire Spaniel is an extinct breed of dog since the early 20th century. It was originally thought to have originated from the work of one of the Dukes of Norfolk, but this theory was disproven after being in doubt during the later part of the 19th century. The term was used to designate springer type spaniels that were neither Sussex nor Clumber Spaniels, and attempts were made to use it to specify a breed that would later become known as the English Springer Spaniel.,With a liver-and-white or black-and-white coat, the Norfolk Spaniel was described as being a large cocker spaniel. The Spaniel Club set out a breed standard for Norfolk Spaniels, but specimens of the breed varied greatly across England. Members of the breed were difficult to train, but formed a strong attachment with their owners and were useful for hunting both on land and in water. The breed ceased to exist after 1903, when it was rolled into the new English Springer Spaniel breed created by The Kennel Club to contain all spaniels of this type.,The Norfolk Spaniel was believed to have come about from a cross of spaniels with the Black and Tan Terrier, which was cultivated by an unspecified Duke of Norfolk. However, later historians disagree with this theory, saying that the Duke of Norfolk's spaniels were of the King Charles type and that terrier stock had nothing to do with the origins of the Norfolk Spaniel. The theory of the Duke of Norfolk-based origins of the Norfolk Spaniel was thought disproved by the investigation of James Farrow, a 19th-century spaniel breeder, who wrote to Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk in order to find out the truth about the origins of the breed. The Duke responded, denying any connection to the breed, although he did state that his grandfather, Henry Howard, 13th Duke of Norfolk, owned Sussex Spaniels. The letter from the Duke was printed in The Kennel Gazette in 1899. An alternative origin was proposed by Rawdon Briggs Lee in volume two of his 1897 work A History and Description of the Modern Dogs of Great Britain and Ireland. Lee argued that the Norfolk Spaniel was descended from a crossing of a curly-coated water spaniel and a Sussex Spaniel or another strain of land spaniel.In the 18th century, spaniels were split into three categories: land spaniels, water spaniels and toy spaniels. The land spaniels were split into two further types, the cocker spaniel and the springer spaniel. It was within the springer spaniel type that the Norfolk Spaniel was placed, along with the Sussex Spaniel and the Clumber Spaniel. By the 1860s, the breed was described as the \"commonest breed in England\", but with a description that varies so much that the only standard point is that they averaged 16 inches (41 cm) in height at the withers.,The Spaniel Club was formed in 1885, and issued a breed standard for the Norfolk Spaniel, recognising it as a variety of spaniel. However, the general public saw it only as a generic land spaniel. By the 1890s, the breed had become common throughout the counties of England, leading dog writers such as Rawdon Briggs Lee to question the authenticity of its origins, or that the various liver and white spaniels from around England constituted a single breed; \"Personally, I do not consider the liver and white spaniel any particular variety at all, nor do I believe that it has ever been indigenous to Norfolk.\" He states that similar dogs exist in Devonshire that do not trace ancestry to Norfolk, and that liver and white spaniels pre-date the breeding of the Black and Tan Terrier with an ordinary spaniel. F.H.F. Mercer described the breed in 1890 as being \"virtually extinct in its purity\", with its liver and white colours running through any numbers of miscellaneous spaniels, and he too discredits the origins involving the Duke of Norfolk.The Kennel Club (UK) designated all medium legged spaniels which were not Clumber nor Sussex Spaniels as English Springer Spaniels in 1902. The Norfolk Spaniel was included under this designation, with the term \"Norfolk Spaniel\" considered for use to cover these types of spaniels, but ultimately rejected as the Club believed that the breed was always liver and white in colour. The change in terminology was not smooth or immediate, with James Watson in his 1905 work, The Dog Book, still referring to the Norfolk Spaniel as a breed name. In the modern era, the Norfolk Spaniel is thought to be the previous name for the English Springer Spaniel, prior to recognition by The Kennel Club (UK).,The Norfolk Spaniel would typically be unhappy when they were separated from their owners, as they formed a strong attachment. Compared to the springer spaniels of the 19th century, they were more ill-tempered, and could be headstrong and wilful if not successfully broken. Some members of the breed could be noisy, and were described as \"babbling\" and making noise on the hunt in a similar fashion to hounds, while others were far quieter.Its use in hunting was varied, and the breed was useful both on land and in the water. In particular, it became successful in America and towards the beginning of the 20th century were popular in the area around Boston. They were described by the Spaniel Club of America as being as good in the water as the Chesapeake Bay Retriever." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5ac" }, "breed": "North Country Beagle", "origin": "Great Britain", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Country_Beagle", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Beagle_%28PSF%29.png/220px-Beagle_%28PSF%29.png", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f38" }, "breed": "North Country Beagle", "contenido": "The North Country Beagle, Northern Hound or Northern Beagle was a breed of dog that existed in Britain probably until early in the 19th century.

Most writers suggest that it was developed from the Talbot, whose origins are also uncertain, but which some have claimed originated in Normandy. The Talbot was a predominantly white, slow, deep-throated, scent hound. At some point the Talbots were crossed with Greyhounds to give them an extra turn of speed, but they remained comparatively slow dogs that relied more on their nose than speed in the chase.The North Country Beagle was a large, bony hound with a square head, and long trailing ears. Chiefly bred in Yorkshire, it was common in the north of England, but below the River Trent the similar Southern Hound was more abundant. The North Country Beagle was a faster dog; in The British Encyclopedia of 1809, William Nicholson says that the North Country Beagle was kept by the \"dashing class of sportsman\" because it could \"run down a brace [of hare] before dinner\", but although a good scent hound, was probably lacking in this ability when compared to the delicate nose of the Southern Hound. The writer and poet Gervase Markham, who wrote a number of books on animal husbandry in the early 17th century described the North Country Beagle as having:,...a head more slender, with a longer nose, ears and flews more shallow, back broad, belly gaunt, joints long, tail small, and his general form more slender and greyhound-like...,In his The Dog, in Health and Disease in 1859, \"Stonehenge\" (the pen name of John Henry Walsh, later editor of The Field) says the two breeds could be differentiated by the large dewlap possessed by the Southern Hound. The Southern Hound seems to have also had a deeper more melodious voice; Markham says the North Country Beagle had \"only a little shrill sweetness\" and lacked depth of tone. How far the Talbot, Northern Hound and Southern Hound were intermixed by the 19th century is impossible to ascertain: while acknowledging that they had once existed as separate breeds, Stonehenge had never seen pure-bred varieties and classified the three breeds together.Both the North Country Beagle and Southern Hound seem to have fallen out of favour during the 18th century as the fashion for less time-consuming hunts led to the development of the faster Foxhound. The North Country Beagle may have formed part of the packs kept by southern farmers for rabbit-hunting that would eventually become the nucleus for the modern Beagle breed. Stonehenge says that packs of hounds that resembled the description of the North Country Beagle still existed in Wales, Devon, Yorkshire and Sussex during the 19th century, but he was doubtful as to how far any of these packs truly represented any of the three early hound breeds.Aside from the Beagle other modern hound breeds are believed to have North Country Beagle blood: Harriers and Foxhounds among others. Coonhounds and Bloodhounds are likely to have had more influence from the Southern Hound and Talbot lines, as they are excellent trackers but not as swift as other hound breeds.,Nicholson, William (1809).

Originating in Scotland, the Paisley Terrier was bred primarily as a pet and showdog version of the Skye Terrier, and was the progenitor of today's Yorkshire Terrier. The breed was called the Paisley Terrier since most of the dogs came from that location, but it was also called the Clydesdale Terrier, for another location in the Clyde Valley where the dogs were bred.,  ,The appearance of the Paisley Terrier was similar to the Skye Terrier, but it was shorter backed and weighed around 7 kg (16 lbs), about half the weight of today's Skye Terrier. The breed had a flowing \"silvery, soft jacket\" (coat) of blue and tan, and was shown along with the hard-coated Skye Terriers. They were further described as having a great profusion of silky fur with very profuse ear feathering (long hair on the ears). To differentiate it from the Skye, it was nicknamed the Silky. From the earliest time of the breed, the beauty of the coat won prizes at dog shows. Traditionally, the dogs were shown standing on a box, so that the length of the silky coat could be shown to its best advantage.The Paisley Terrier was described in 1894 as \"an excellent house dog, and most suitable for a lady who wishes something more substantial than a toy\", but the care requirements for the coat made it less desirable than some other popular breeds as a pet.,In a book written in 1894, the author speculates that the Paisley Terrier was created by fanciers in Glasgow who selected Skye Terriers with short backs and long, silky coats \"until they bred fairly truly\".Describing the Paisley Terrier in 1894, Rawdon Lee writes that \"Though he can kill rats, and maybe other vermin, the Paisley Terrier is essentially a pet dog, and is usually kept as such.\"  The breed was primarily a pet, and it was also a popular show dog. In 1903, the breed is referred to as \"a fancier's dog, a sport from the Skye Terrier stock\" and despite some fanciers of the time claiming that the breed had the \"hardiness and fitness for terrier work... it is evident that a dog with a coat that looks like silk is simply a toy.\" Owners and breeders in the 1800s placed a high value on the beautiful blue and tan coat, and would cover the dog's feet and tie the hair back over their eyes to keep the coat looking at its best for dog shows.The Kennel Club recognised the Paisley Terrier in 1888 as a variety of the Skye Terrier, even though separate show classes had been held for the two types in 1887. However, there were so few entries that the Kennel Club did not continue to encourage offering the category at further exhibitions.The breed's success as a show dog may have led to its decline. Judges would give awards to the dogs with the long, attractive coat, since length of coat was a principal factor in Skye Terriers. The Paisleys, bred for long but soft coats (useless for a working dog), would win the prizes. Skye Terrier fanciers objected to the type being shown with Skyes, since they considered the Paisleys to be mixed breeds or possibly crossed with Dandie Dinmont Terriers. The interest of fanciers declined, and the breed began to disappear.A book published in 1918 describes Paisley Terriers as uncommon and \"I doubt that you'll ever see one in the United States.\" But with the availability of Internet-based dog registries that will register breeds with little or no documentation, combined with the public's appetite for unique or rare pets, it is likely that there will be attempts to reconstitute the breed.,The famous 1860s showdog Huddersfield Ben came from Paisley Terrier stock in the 1860s, and is considered by all authorities to be the founding sire of the Yorkshire Terrier breed, although the Yorkshire Terrier was not recognized until 1890. It is also the ancestor of many other breeds, notably the Silky Terrier and the Biewer Terrier." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5b7" }, "breed": "Southern Hound", "origin": "Britain", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hound", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Southern_Hound.jpg/220px-Southern_Hound.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fc1" }, "breed": "Southern Hound", "contenido": "The Southern Hound was a breed of dog that existed in Britain probably until sometime in the 19th century, now extinct. The exact date of its extinction is not known; it is likely that it was gradually interbred with other breeds until the genuine Southern Hound bloodline ceased to exist.,The origins of the Southern Hound are equally unclear. Most writers suggest that it is derived from the Talbot, which was a predominantly white, slow, deep-throated, scent hound, also of uncertain origin, though it is sometimes claimed that it came from Normandy. It is suggested that at some point the Talbot was crossed with Greyhounds to give them an extra turn of speed. However, in The Dog published in 1852, William Youatt states that the Southern Hound may have existed in Britain since ancient times rather than being brought from France by the Normans.,The Southern Hound was a tall, heavy dog with a square head, and long ears. It had a deep chest, a long bony body and a deep melodious voice. It was a slow dog, but with excellent scenting abilities and was employed to follow the trail of the quarry during a hunt. Because of its lack of speed and deliberate nature, it was considered best used for hunting game such as hare or deer, which would eventually be exhausted by its relentless pursuit and, unlike a fox or rabbit, could not escape to the safety of a den or burrow.,It was still common south of the River Trent in the 18th century. Further north the North Country Beagle or Northern Hound was favoured. This was a faster dog but probably lacked the delicate nose of the Southern Hound. In his The Dog, in Health and Disease in 1859, \"Stonehenge\" (the pen name of John Henry Walsh, editor of The Field) magazine says the two breeds could be differentiated by the large dewlap present in the Southern Hound, but the illustration of the Southern Hound in the same book lacks this detail. How far the Talbot, Northern Hound and Southern Hound were intermixed is impossible to ascertain: authors writing in the mid-19th century were already having difficulty distinguishing between the three breeds.The Southern Hound seems to have fallen out of favour during the 18th century as the fashion for shorter hunts led to the development of the faster Foxhound. Youatt wrote that there were still packs in use in Devon in the 19th century and that the Southern Hound was sometimes used in conjunction with Foxhound packs to help pick up the cold trail when the pack lost the scent. Some were employed in Wales on polecat hunts (that could last several days), and they appear to have been used to hunt otter before being employed as breeding stock for the development of the Otterhound." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5ba" }, "breed": "Talbot Hound", "origin": "Uncertain, possibly Belgium / France (Normandy) or England", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talbot_(dog)", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/TalbotHound_Talbot_Shrewsbury_Book_1445.png/220px-TalbotHound_Talbot_Shrewsbury_Book_1445.png", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fd4" }, "breed": "Talbot Hound", "contenido": "The Talbot was a  type of hunting hound common in England during the Middle Ages. It is depicted in art of the period as small to medium-sized, white in colour, with short legs, large powerful feet, a deep chest with a slender waist, long drooping ears, and a very long curled tail. It is shown in one well-known example at Haddon Hall with a fierce facial expression. It is now extinct, but is believed to be an ancestor of the modern Beagle and Bloodhound. It is uncertain whether it was a scenthound (bred for the quality of its nose), a sighthound (bred for the quality of sight and speed), or a dog used for digging out quarry, nor is it known what type of quarry it hunted, whether deer, fox, boar, etc.,In medieval times, \"Talbot\" was a common name for an individual hound, as used before 1400 in Chaucer's The Nun's Priest's Tale (line 3383), and is used as an example of a hound name in George Turberville's 1575 work The Noble Art of Venerie or Huntyng.By the 17th century it clearly existed as a breed or type. Large, heavy, slow hounds were 'talbot-like', whatever their colour, though the 'milk white' was 'the true talbot'. In his poem \"The Chase\", published in 1735, William Somervile describes the use of \"lime-hounds\" (leash hounds) on the Scottish Borders to catch thieves, obviously referring to the Bloodhound and the sleuth hound, but adds that the (white) Talbot was the \"prime\" example of this type of hound.,The origin of both the name and the animal is uncertain. In a quotation from about 1449, the king referred to John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury as \"Talbott, oure good dogge\", perhaps as a play on his name, or in allusion to that family's  heraldic badge. In a 1445 illuminated manuscript in the British Library John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury is depicted presenting a Book of Romances to Queen Margaret of Anjou, with a short-legged and long-eared white hound standing behind him, which serves to identify him symbolically. It is very similar to a 15th-century depiction on a ceiling at Haddon Hall, Derbyshire, made following the marriage of Sir Henry Vernon (1445-1515) to Ann Talbot, daughter of John Talbot, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury.,The Talbot and the Greyhound were, apparently, the only hounds used in English heraldry, and it could be that the Talbot originated as an emblematic or heraldic hound. References to this heraldic Talbot seem to be earlier than any references to a real dog. The Talbot appears in many coats of arms, for instance in later ones of the Earls of Shrewsbury, in which two Talbots appear as supporters.[1],It is quite plausible that from these beginnings the name \"Talbot\" was extended to any large, heavy, white scent hound, and from there helped to establish a breed or type. It was certainly similar to the Bloodhound (\"white\" is given as one of the colours of the Bloodhound in the 16th and 17th centuries) as regards size, and as regards use to a leash-hound.As earliest references to this dog are much later than those to Bloodhounds, it cannot convincingly be regarded as an ancestor of the Bloodhound.,The Talbot seems to have existed as a breed, a little distinct from the Bloodhound, until the end of the 18th century, after which, like two other large breeds to which it may have been related, the Northern Hound and the Southern Hound, it disappeared. Some early dog-shows apparently offered classes for Talbots, but attracted no entrants, so they were dropped." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5bb" }, "breed": "Toy Bulldog", "origin": null, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Bulldog", "img": "Not available", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fe4" }, "breed": "Toy Bulldog", "contenido": "The toy bulldog is an extinct unrecognized breed of small bulldog that existed in England during the 18th and early 19th centuries.,The same name is used for unrelated, but similar-appearing dogs, that are mostly modern crosses between bulldogs and pugs, which are also not a recognized dog breed.,Early dog breeders worked in two different directions, to decrease the weight to a desirable 20 pounds or so and create a new toy bulldog breed:,One method was to downsize the bulldog by selecting smaller individuals for breeding. This was not very successful, due to medical complications with breeding below normal-sized dogs. Natural dwarf bulldog puppies are occasionally borne by normal-sized parents, but they were neither the healthiest, nor the most fertile dogs, and their own puppies were often regular-sized dogs. Thus, this version of the breed was never established.,An alternate attempt at creating a toy bulldog was via crossbreeding French bulldogs with standard bulldogs or with the crossed offspring. Several dogs were presented as breed candidates by \"The French Toy Bulldog Club of England\" to the Kennel Club. English breeders and Kennel Club representatives refused to call a mixed-breed dog a \"bulldog\", and this variety of dog has also not developed to the point of a recognized breed.The breeding programs were dropped and the line of dogs bred from these early attempts died out.,Nowadays, the term toy bulldog is occasionally used to describe a small variety of another cross also called a miniature bulldog.

The type is now extinct. It is mentioned in Of English Dogs in 1576 under the name \"Turnespete\". William Bingley's Memoirs of British Quadrupeds (1809) also talks of a dog employed to help chefs and cooks. It is also known as the Kitchen Dog, the Cooking Dog, the Underdog and the Vernepator. In Linnaeus's 18th-century classification of dogs it is listed as Canis vertigus. The breed was lost, since it was considered to be such a lowly and common dog that no record was effectively kept of it. Some sources consider the Turnspit dog a kind of Glen of Imaal Terrier, while others make it a relative of the Welsh Corgi.A preserved example of a Turnspit dog is displayed at Abergavenny Museum in Abergavenny, Great Britain.,The Vernepator Cur was bred to run on a wheel in order to turn meat so it would cook evenly. Due to the strenuous nature of the work, a pair of dogs would often be worked in shifts. According to John George Wood in The Illustrated Natural History (Mammalia) (1853):,Just as the invention of the spinning jenny abolished the use of distaff and wheel, which were formerly the occupants of every well-ordained English cottage, so the invention of automaton roasting-jacks has destroyed the occupation of the Turnspit Dog, and by degrees has almost annihilated its very existence. Here and there a solitary Turnspit may be seen, just as a spinning-wheel or a distaff may be seen in a few isolated cottages; but both the Dog and the implement are exceptions to the general rule, and are only worthy of notice as being curious relics of a bygone time.,In former days, and even within the remembrance of the present generation, the task of roasting a joint of meat or a fowl was a comparatively serious one, and required the constant attendance of the cook, in order to prevent the meat from being spoiled by the unequal action of the fire. The smoke-jack, as it was rather improperly termed\u2014inasmuch as it was turned, not by the smoke, but by the heated air that rushed up the chimney\u2014was a great improvement, because the spit revolved at a rate that corresponded with the heat of the fire.,So complicated an apparatus, however, could not be applied to all chimneys, or in all localities, and therefore the services of the Turnspit Dog were brought into requisition. At one extremity of the spit was fastened a large circular box, or hollow wheel, something like the wire wheels which are so often appended to squirrel-cages; and in this wheel the Dog was accustomed to perform its daily task, by keeping it continually working. As the labour would be too great for a single Dog, it was usual to keep at least two animals for the purpose, and to make them relieve each other at regular intervals. The dogs were quite able to appreciate the lapse of time, and, if not relieved from their toils at the proper hour, would leap out of the wheel without orders, and force their companions to take their place, and complete their portion of the daily toil.,The dogs were also taken to church to serve as foot warmers. One story says that during service at a church in Bath, the Bishop of Gloucester gave a sermon and uttered the line \"It was then that Ezekiel saw the wheel...\". At the mention of the word \"wheel\" several turnspit dogs, who had been brought to church as foot warmers, ran for the door.Queen Victoria kept retired Turnspit dogs as pets.,Turnspit dogs were described as \"long-bodied, crooked-legged and ugly dogs, with a suspicious, unhappy look about them\". Delabere Blaine, a 19th-century veterinarian (and self-described \"father of canine pathology\"), classified the Turnspit dog as a variety of spaniel. Often, they are shown with a white stripe down the center of their faces. According to Bingley's Memoirs of British Quadrupeds (1809):,The Turnspits are remarkable for their great length of body and short and usually crooked legs. Their colour is generally a dusky grey spotted with black or entirely black with the under parts whitish." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5c1" }, "breed": "American Bulldog", "origin": "United States", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bulldog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Faithfullbull_Spike_of_Mightybull.jpg/220px-Faithfullbull_Spike_of_Mightybull.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c675" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/american_bulldog.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 2, "grooming": 0, "drooling": 0, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 0, "playfulness": 0, "protectiveness": 0, "trainability": 4, "energy": 0, "barking": 1, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 12, "max_height_male": 28, "max_height_female": 24, "max_weight_male": 100, "max_weight_female": 80, "min_height_male": 20, "min_height_female": 20, "min_weight_male": 75, "min_weight_female": 60, "breed": "American Bulldog" }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c726" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/american_bulldog.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 2, "grooming": 0, "drooling": 0, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 0, "playfulness": 0, "protectiveness": 0, "trainability": 4, "energy": 0, "barking": 1, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 12, "max_height_male": 28, "max_height_female": 24, "max_weight_male": 100, "max_weight_female": 80, "min_height_male": 20, "min_height_female": 20, "min_weight_male": 75, "min_weight_female": 60, "breed": "American Bulldog" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5de7" }, "breed": "American Bulldog", "contenido": "The American Bulldog is a large, muscular breed of working dog that were used as stock dogs, catch dogs, and guardians on farms and ranches. They are descended from the Old English Bulldog, which is thought to have arrived in America as early as the 17th century, brought over by working-class immigrants from England. During WWI and WWII, the breed was on the verge of extinction, with the only surviving dogs being kept primarily on farms in the southeast. John D. Johnson and Alan Scott are widely regarded as the forefathers of rescuing the breed from extinction. On January 1, 1999 the United Kennel Club first recognized the American Bulldog. In November 2019, the American Bulldog was added to the American Kennel Club (AKC) Foundation Stock Service (FSS).,The Old English Bulldog was preserved by working class immigrants who brought their working dogs with them to the American South; these dogs are believed to have first appeared as early as the 17th century. Small farmers and ranchers used this all-around working dog for many tasks including farm guardians, stock dogs and catch dogs. These dogs were not a bona fide breed by modern standards as was the case for most other dogs: kennel clubs and breed registries did not exist until 1875, at least two centuries after the Old English Bulldog first migrated to America.  In the 17th and 18th century, the Old English Bulldog had many different strains for cattle-droving, bull-baiting, farm dogs, and butcher's dogs. Bull-baiting was also a common blood sport of the era and though there is evidence of such migrating to America with the landrace bulldogs brought by working class Englishmen in colonial times, it is also certain that the strains that migrated to America were unaffected by the banning of the sport in 1835 in the U.K. and, therefore, there was no need for a decline in the population of the old-type bulldog.,In America, there are no records but rather acknowledged landrace strains that initially depended on where a dog's master originated in England, the majority of which were bred to work as evidenced by accounts of the age in local newspapers and written inventories upon death. Later, breeding decisions were dependent on the best working farm dogs, despite breed or background. Later, in states like Texas, several separate strains of the \"bulldog\"-type dogs were kept by ranchers as utilitarian working dogs. Other dogs in time became guard dogs on plantations.Perhaps the most important role of the American Bulldog and the reason for its survival, and in fact why it thrived throughout the South, was because of the presence of feral pigs, introduced to the New World and without predators. The bulldogs were the settlers' only means of sufficiently dealing with the vermin.,By World War II, the breed was near extinction until John D. Johnson scoured the back roads of the South looking for the best specimens to revive the breed. During this time, a young Alan Scott grew an interest in Johnson's dogs and began to work with him on the revitalization process. At some point, Scott began infusing non-Johnson catch bulldogs from working Southern farms with Johnson's lines, creating what is now known as the Standard type American Bulldog, also called the Scott type. At another point, Johnson began crossing his original lines with an atavistic English bulldog from the North that had maintained its genetic athletic vigor, creating the Bully type American Bulldog, also known as the Johnson type or the Classic type.,American Bulldogs are now safe from extinction and their popularity has increased in their homeland, either as a working/protector dog, as a family pet, or both. All over the world, they are used variously as \"hog dogs\" (catching escaped pigs or hunting razorbacks), as cattle drovers, and as working or sport K-9s. American Bulldogs also successfully compete in several dog sports such as dog obedience, Schutzhund, French Ring, Mondioring, Iron Dog competition and weight pulling. They are also exhibited in conformation shows in the UKC, ABA, ABRA, ORKC, EKC.  The AKC added the American Bulldog to the FSS on November 11, 2019.,The American Bulldog is a stocky, well-built, strong-looking dog, with a large head and a muscular build. The shoulders and chest tend to be the most muscular parts of the American Bulldog. Its coat is short and generally smooth, requiring little maintenance except a bath every few weeks. The breed is a light to moderate shedder. Colors, while historically predominantly white with patches of red, black, or brindle, have grown in recent years to include many color patterns including black, red, brown, fawn, and all shades of brindle. Black pigmentation on the nose and eye rims is traditionally preferred, with only some pink allowed. Eye color is usually brown, but heterochromia also occurs, although this is also considered a cosmetic fault. American Bulldogs are known to drool more than other breeds of dog. The Bully type is generally a larger, heavier dog with a shorter muzzle, but the muzzle should never be so short that it causes difficulty with breathing. Standard types are generally more athletic with longer muzzles and a more square head. Many modern American Bulldogs are a combination of the two types, usually termed \"hybrid.\" In general, American Bulldogs weigh between 27 and 54 kg (60 to 120 lb) and are 52 to 70 cm (20 to 28 in) at the withers, but have been known to greatly exceed these dimensions, especially in the \"out of standard,\" nonworking stock.,The American Bulldog is a large, muscular breed of working dog that were used as stock dogs, catch dogs, and guardians on farms and ranches. They are descended from the Old English Bulldog, which is thought to have arrived in America as early as the 17th century, brought over by working-class immigrants from England. During WWI and WWII, the breed was on the verge of extinction, with the only surviving dogs being kept primarily on farms in the southeast. John D. Johnson and Alan Scott are widely regarded as the forefathers of rescuing the breed from extinction. On January 1, 1999 the United Kennel Club first recognized the American Bulldog. In November 2019, the American Bulldog was added to the American Kennel Club (AKC) Foundation Stock Service (FSS).,The Old English Bulldog was preserved by working class immigrants who brought their working dogs with them to the American South; these dogs are believed to have first appeared as early as the 17th century. Small farmers and ranchers used this all-around working dog for many tasks including farm guardians, stock dogs and catch dogs. These dogs were not a bona fide breed by modern standards as was the case for most other dogs: kennel clubs and breed registries did not exist until 1875, at least two centuries after the Old English Bulldog first migrated to America.  In the 17th and 18th century, the Old English Bulldog had many different strains for cattle-droving, bull-baiting, farm dogs, and butcher's dogs. Bull-baiting was also a common blood sport of the era and though there is evidence of such migrating to America with the landrace bulldogs brought by working class Englishmen in colonial times, it is also certain that the strains that migrated to America were unaffected by the banning of the sport in 1835 in the U.K. and, therefore, there was no need for a decline in the population of the old-type bulldog.,In America, there are no records but rather acknowledged landrace strains that initially depended on where a dog's master originated in England, the majority of which were bred to work as evidenced by accounts of the age in local newspapers and written inventories upon death. Later, breeding decisions were dependent on the best working farm dogs, despite breed or background. Later, in states like Texas, several separate strains of the \"bulldog\"-type dogs were kept by ranchers as utilitarian working dogs. Other dogs in time became guard dogs on plantations.Perhaps the most important role of the American Bulldog and the reason for its survival, and in fact why it thrived throughout the South, was because of the presence of feral pigs, introduced to the New World and without predators. The bulldogs were the settlers' only means of sufficiently dealing with the vermin.,By World War II, the breed was near extinction until John D. Johnson scoured the back roads of the South looking for the best specimens to revive the breed. During this time, a young Alan Scott grew an interest in Johnson's dogs and began to work with him on the revitalization process. At some point, Scott began infusing non-Johnson catch bulldogs from working Southern farms with Johnson's lines, creating what is now known as the Standard type American Bulldog, also called the Scott type. At another point, Johnson began crossing his original lines with an atavistic English bulldog from the North that had maintained its genetic athletic vigor, creating the Bully type American Bulldog, also known as the Johnson type or the Classic type.,American Bulldogs are now safe from extinction and their popularity has increased in their homeland, either as a working/protector dog, as a family pet, or both. All over the world, they are used variously as \"hog dogs\" (catching escaped pigs or hunting razorbacks), as cattle drovers, and as working or sport K-9s. American Bulldogs also successfully compete in several dog sports such as dog obedience, Schutzhund, French Ring, Mondioring, Iron Dog competition and weight pulling. They are also exhibited in conformation shows in the UKC, ABA, ABRA, ORKC, EKC.  The AKC added the American Bulldog to the FSS on November 11, 2019.,The American Bulldog is a stocky, well-built, strong-looking dog, with a large head and a muscular build. The shoulders and chest tend to be the most muscular parts of the American Bulldog. Its coat is short and generally smooth, requiring little maintenance except a bath every few weeks. The breed is a light to moderate shedder. Colors, while historically predominantly white with patches of red, black, or brindle, have grown in recent years to include many color patterns including black, red, brown, fawn, and all shades of brindle. Black pigmentation on the nose and eye rims is traditionally preferred, with only some pink allowed. Eye color is usually brown, but heterochromia also occurs, although this is also considered a cosmetic fault. American Bulldogs are known to drool more than other breeds of dog.

During this time, a young Alan Scott grew an interest in Johnson's dogs and began to work with him on the revitalization process. At some point, Scott began infusing non-Johnson catch bulldogs from working Southern farms with Johnson's lines, creating what is now known as the Standard type American Bulldog, also called the Scott type. At another point, Johnson began crossing his original lines with an atavistic English bulldog from the North that had maintained its genetic athletic vigor, creating the Bully type American Bulldog, also known as the Johnson type or the Classic type.,American Bulldogs are now safe from extinction and their popularity has increased in their homeland, either as a working/protector dog, as a family pet, or both. All over the world, they are used variously as \"hog dogs\" (catching escaped pigs or hunting razorbacks), as cattle drovers, and as working or sport K-9s. American Bulldogs also successfully compete in several dog sports such as dog obedience, Schutzhund, French Ring, Mondioring, Iron Dog competition and weight pulling. They are also exhibited in conformation shows in the UKC, ABA, ABRA, ORKC, EKC.  The AKC added the American Bulldog to the FSS on November 11, 2019.,The American Bulldog is a stocky, well-built, strong-looking dog, with a large head and a muscular build. The shoulders and chest tend to be the most muscular parts of the American Bulldog. Its coat is short and generally smooth, requiring little maintenance except a bath every few weeks. The breed is a light to moderate shedder. Colors, while historically predominantly white with patches of red, black, or brindle, have grown in recent years to include many color patterns including black, red, brown, fawn, and all shades of brindle. Black pigmentation on the nose and eye rims is traditionally preferred, with only some pink allowed. Eye color is usually brown, but heterochromia also occurs, although this is also considered a cosmetic fault. American Bulldogs are known to drool more than other breeds of dog. The Bully type is generally a larger, heavier dog with a shorter muzzle, but the muzzle should never be so short that it causes difficulty with breathing. Standard types are generally more athletic with longer muzzles and a more square head. Many modern American Bulldogs are a combination of the two types, usually termed \"hybrid.\" In general, American Bulldogs weigh between 27 and 54 kg (60 to 120 lb) and are 52 to 70 cm (20 to 28 in) at the withers, but have been known to greatly exceed these dimensions, especially in the \"out of standard,\" nonworking stock.,The American Bulldog is a large, muscular breed of working dog that were used as stock dogs, catch dogs, and guardians on farms and ranches. They are descended from the Old English Bulldog, which is thought to have arrived in America as early as the 17th century, brought over by working-class immigrants from England. During WWI and WWII, the breed was on the verge of extinction, with the only surviving dogs being kept primarily on farms in the southeast. John D. Johnson and Alan Scott are widely regarded as the forefathers of rescuing the breed from extinction. On January 1, 1999 the United Kennel Club first recognized the American Bulldog. In November 2019, the American Bulldog was added to the American Kennel Club (AKC) Foundation Stock Service (FSS).,The Old English Bulldog was preserved by working class immigrants who brought their working dogs with them to the American South; these dogs are believed to have first appeared as early as the 17th century. Small farmers and ranchers used this all-around working dog for many tasks including farm guardians, stock dogs and catch dogs. These dogs were not a bona fide breed by modern standards as was the case for most other dogs: kennel clubs and breed registries did not exist until 1875, at least two centuries after the Old English Bulldog first migrated to America.  In the 17th and 18th century, the Old English Bulldog had many different strains for cattle-droving, bull-baiting, farm dogs, and butcher's dogs. Bull-baiting was also a common blood sport of the era and though there is evidence of such migrating to America with the landrace bulldogs brought by working class Englishmen in colonial times, it is also certain that the strains that migrated to America were unaffected by the banning of the sport in 1835 in the U.K. and, therefore, there was no need for a decline in the population of the old-type bulldog.,In America, there are no records but rather acknowledged landrace strains that initially depended on where a dog's master originated in England, the majority of which were bred to work as evidenced by accounts of the age in local newspapers and written inventories upon death. Later, breeding decisions were dependent on the best working farm dogs, despite breed or background. Later, in states like Texas, several separate strains of the \"bulldog\"-type dogs were kept by ranchers as utilitarian working dogs. Other dogs in time became guard dogs on plantations.Perhaps the most important role of the American Bulldog and the reason for its survival, and in fact why it thrived throughout the South, was because of the presence of feral pigs, introduced to the New World and without predators.

In November 2019, the American Bulldog was added to the American Kennel Club (AKC) Foundation Stock Service (FSS).,The Old English Bulldog was preserved by working class immigrants who brought their working dogs with them to the American South; these dogs are believed to have first appeared as early as the 17th century. Small farmers and ranchers used this all-around working dog for many tasks including farm guardians, stock dogs and catch dogs. These dogs were not a bona fide breed by modern standards as was the case for most other dogs: kennel clubs and breed registries did not exist until 1875, at least two centuries after the Old English Bulldog first migrated to America.  In the 17th and 18th century, the Old English Bulldog had many different strains for cattle-droving, bull-baiting, farm dogs, and butcher's dogs. Bull-baiting was also a common blood sport of the era and though there is evidence of such migrating to America with the landrace bulldogs brought by working class Englishmen in colonial times, it is also certain that the strains that migrated to America were unaffected by the banning of the sport in 1835 in the U.K. and, therefore, there was no need for a decline in the population of the old-type bulldog.,In America, there are no records but rather acknowledged landrace strains that initially depended on where a dog's master originated in England, the majority of which were bred to work as evidenced by accounts of the age in local newspapers and written inventories upon death. Later, breeding decisions were dependent on the best working farm dogs, despite breed or background. Later, in states like Texas, several separate strains of the \"bulldog\"-type dogs were kept by ranchers as utilitarian working dogs. Other dogs in time became guard dogs on plantations.Perhaps the most important role of the American Bulldog and the reason for its survival, and in fact why it thrived throughout the South, was because of the presence of feral pigs, introduced to the New World and without predators. The bulldogs were the settlers' only means of sufficiently dealing with the vermin.,By World War II, the breed was near extinction until John D. Johnson scoured the back roads of the South looking for the best specimens to revive the breed. During this time, a young Alan Scott grew an interest in Johnson's dogs and began to work with him on the revitalization process. At some point, Scott began infusing non-Johnson catch bulldogs from working Southern farms with Johnson's lines, creating what is now known as the Standard type American Bulldog, also called the Scott type. At another point, Johnson began crossing his original lines with an atavistic English bulldog from the North that had maintained its genetic athletic vigor, creating the Bully type American Bulldog, also known as the Johnson type or the Classic type.,American Bulldogs are now safe from extinction and their popularity has increased in their homeland, either as a working/protector dog, as a family pet, or both. All over the world, they are used variously as \"hog dogs\" (catching escaped pigs or hunting razorbacks), as cattle drovers, and as working or sport K-9s. American Bulldogs also successfully compete in several dog sports such as dog obedience, Schutzhund, French Ring, Mondioring, Iron Dog competition and weight pulling.

The Bully type is generally a larger, heavier dog with a shorter muzzle, but the muzzle should never be so short that it causes difficulty with breathing. Standard types are generally more athletic with longer muzzles and a more square head.

It is descended from hunting hounds, especially foxhounds, brought to America by settlers during the 17th and 18th centuries. The breed's first recognition came from the United Kennel Club in 1905 as the English Fox and Coonhound. Further recognition has been granted in recent years by the American Kennel Club, first in the Foundation Stock Service and in 2011 as a fully recognized member of the hound group.,The breed is of medium height and proportionate weight, and their coats come predominantly in three types: redtick, bluetick, and a tricolor tick pattern. The English Coonhound has a high prey drive and, while it is typically used in 'coon hunting', it is also skilled in treeing. This breed is generally a healthy one, but it is recommended that prospective owners learn to recognize symptoms of bloat, as its large size and deep chest put them at risk of this condition.,The breed's ancestry can be traced back to foxhounds brought to the United States by European settlers during the 17th and 18th centuries. It shares a common ancestry with all other coonhounds, with the exception of the Plott Hound. The breed developed from 'Virginia Hounds', which were developed over time from dogs imported to the United States by Robert Brooke, Thomas Walker and the first President of the United States, George Washington. The terrain here was much rougher than what they were used to, so the breed was specifically bred over time to better adapt to these new conditions. It was traditionally used to hunt raccoons by night and the American red fox by day. The United Kennel Club (UKC) first recognized it in 1905 as the English Fox and Coonhound.The Treeing Walker Coonhound was recognized separately by the UKC in 1945, separating it from the English Fox and Coonhound breed. The following year, the Bluetick Coonhound was also split into an entirely different breed.The English Coonhound was accepted into the American Kennel Club's Foundation Stock Service as the American English Coonhound in 1995. On 1 January, 2010, it was moved up to the Miscellaneous Class. Following the recognition of the breed by the AKC in the hound group on 30 June 2011 as the 171st breed, the American English Coonhound became eligible to compete in the National Dog Show in 2011, followed by its eligibility for the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show and the AKC National Championship for the first time in 2012.,Male English Coonhounds measure between 22\u201327 inches (56\u201369 cm) at the withers, with females being slightly smaller at 21\u201325 inches (53\u201364 cm). The weight of a Coonhound should be in proportion to the dog's height.,Unlike the other breeds of coonhounds, a variety of colorations is acceptable to meet English Coonhound breed standards. Coloration can be redtick, bluetick, tricolored and tricolored with ticking. However, red markings are predominant and \"Redtick\" is a common term for English Coonhounds. Some believe this lack of emphasis on specific coloration has allowed breeders to focus breeding programs on traits such as intelligence and hunting ability rather than appearance and coat standards. Color variations are common even among pups from the same litter of English Coonhounds, indicating high levels of DNA diversity in the breed. The coat is short and coarse." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5c6" }, "breed": "Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog", "origin": "Australia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Stumpy_Tail_Cattle_Dog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Australian_Stumpy_Tail_Cattle_Dog.jpg/220px-Australian_Stumpy_Tail_Cattle_Dog.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c728" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/australian_stumpy_tail_cattle_dog.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 1, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 3, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 1, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 3, "energy": 5, "barking": 1, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 15, "max_height_male": 20, "max_height_female": 20, "max_weight_male": 45, "max_weight_female": 35, "min_height_male": 18, "min_height_female": 18, "min_weight_male": 38, "min_weight_female": 32, "breed": "Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5dfd" }, "breed": "Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog", "contenido": "The Stumpy Tailed Heeler is a naturally bobtailed  or tailless, medium-sized cattle dog similar and/or related to the Australian Cattle Dog (aka, \"Blue/Red Heeler\"). The Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog was developed in Australia  to herd cattle, and descends from crosses between European herding dogs and the Australian dingo. The name is spelled both with hyphenation, and without, and while the shorter name Heeler is sometimes applied, the name Heeler most often refers to the Australian Cattle Dog .,There are a number of theories on the origin of the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog. One is that it descended from Halls Heelers, a dog produced from crossing the Northumberland Blue Merle Drovers dogs with other herding breed. Some early dog breeders believed Dalmatian and Australian Kelpies were included. Some believe that Bull Terrier heritage may have occurred. Others believe that this dog developed from crossing first the Black Bobtail Smithfield herding dog of England, which were brought to Australia in the early 19th century, with the dingo to produce the Red Bobtail, and then crossing with the Smooth-haired Blue Merle Collie. Records of working dogs are scarce from this time period, and there are differing accounts of the breed's development. One is that a drover named Timmins from Bathurst, New South Wales, crossed the Smithfield dogs with dingoes, producing a type of working dog called Timmins' Biters. In order to mute their dingo characteristics and make the dogs easier to handle, further crosses were made with Smooth Collies, producing speckled red and blue dogs that were often born tailless.In the book A Dog Called Blue, author Noreen Clark makes the case that both the tailless Heeler and the Australian Cattle Dog (a.k.a. \"Queensland Heeler\") descended at one point from the same stock, called Halls Heelers, kept in the 1830s by a very large cattle operation run by Thomas Hall. The dogs were also crosses of Smithfield dogs and dingoes, but the breeds diverged at some point in the late 20th century. Selective breeding of the tailless or short-tailed dogs has fixed the characteristic of today's breed.,The Blue Heeler has been recognised as a standardised breed since 1988 in its native country by the Australian National Kennel Council, in its \"Group 5 (Working dogs)\". It is also recognised by the nearby New Zealand Kennel Club in its \"Working\" group.More internationally, the breed was provisionally accepted by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 2005, as breed standard 351, in \"Group 1, Section 2: Cattle Dogs (Except Swiss Cattle Dogs)\".  As of 2010, it is also recognised as simply the Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog by the US United Kennel Club (in its \"Herding Dog Breeds\" group) since 1996, and by the longer name in the Canadian Kennel Club (in its \"Group VII: Herding Dogs\"), but not by the Kennel Club (UK), nor by the American Kennel Club.The breed may also be listed by minor kennel clubs, working or herding dog clubs, or Internet-based dog registry businesses, and promoted as a rare breed pet.,The Heeler is a normally proportioned, rugged dog with pricked (standing up) ears and long legs. The breed's most distinctive feature, for which the breed is named, is the frequent lack of a tail. When there is a tail, it is quite short, no longer than 10 cm (4 in.), and undocked. The coat is medium length to short, straight, dense and harsh. The coat color is a speckled red or speckled blue. Heelers do not show brown points or markings as seen on the ACD. Height is  46\u201351 centimetres (18\u201320 in) at the withers for dogs, with bitches being slightly smaller. Blue Heelers (a.k.a. \"Queensland Heeler\") (with a long tail) is similar in appearance to the Heeler, but the Australian Cattle Dog is proportionally heavier, less leggy and has brown points and markings.(See the article Dog terminology for an explanation of terms.)" }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5cb" }, "breed": "Bloodhound", "origin": "Belgium, France &United Kingdom", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodhound", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Bloodhound_Erland22.jpg/220px-Bloodhound_Erland22.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c72a" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/bloodhound.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 5, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 2, "trainability": 4, "energy": 3, "barking": 5, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 12, "max_height_male": 27, "max_height_female": 27, "max_weight_male": 110, "max_weight_female": 100, "min_height_male": 25, "min_height_female": 25, "min_weight_male": 90, "min_weight_female": 80, "breed": "Bloodhound" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e1e" }, "breed": "Bloodhound", "contenido": "The bloodhound is a large scent hound, originally bred for hunting deer, wild boar and, since the Middle Ages, for tracking people.

The coat is smooth and tight-fitting; colors are fawn, brindled, or white, with or without white markings. Boxers are brachycephalic (they have broad, short skulls), have a square muzzle, mandibular prognathism (an underbite), very strong jaws, and a powerful bite ideal for hanging on to large prey. The Boxer was bred from the Old English Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser, which became extinct by crossbreeding rather than by a decadence of the breed. The Boxer is a member of both The Kennel Club and American Kennel Club (AKC) Working Group.The first Boxer club was founded in 1895, with Boxers being first exhibited in a dog show for St. Bernards in Munich the next year. Based on 2013 AKC statistics, Boxers held steady as the seventh-most popular breed of dog in the United States for the fourth consecutive year. According to the AKC's website, though, the boxer is now the 11th-most popular dog breed in the United States.,The head is the most distinctive feature of the Boxer. The breed standard dictates that it must be in perfect proportion to the body and above all it must never be too light. The greatest value is to be placed on the muzzle being of correct form and in absolute proportion to the skull. The length of the muzzle to the whole of the head should be a ratio of 1:3. Folds are always present from the root of the nose running downwards on both sides of the muzzle, and the tip of the nose should lie somewhat higher than the root of the muzzle. In addition, a Boxer should be slightly prognathous, i.e., the lower jaw should protrude beyond the upper jaw and bend slightly upwards in what is commonly called an underbite or \"undershot bite\".Boxers were originally a docked and cropped breed, and this is still done in some countries, but due to pressure from veterinary associations, animal rights groups, and the general public, both cropping of the ears and docking of the tail have been prohibited in many countries around the world, and is not recognised by the breed standard laid down by The Kennel Club of the UK. The American Kennel club still permits cropped ears. A line of naturally short-tailed (bobtail) Boxers was developed in the United Kingdom in anticipation of a tail-docking ban there; after several generations of controlled breeding, these dogs were accepted in the Kennel Club (UK) registry in 1998, and today representatives of the bobtail line can be found in many countries. In 2008, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) added a \"naturally stumpy tail\" as a disqualifying fault in their breed standard, meaning those Boxers born with a bobtail can no longer be shown in FCI member countries. In the United States and Canada as of 2012, cropped ears are still more common in show dogs,  though the practice of cosmetic cropping is currently opposed by the American Veterinary Medical Association. In March 2005, the AKC breed standard was changed to include a description of the uncropped ear, but to severely penalize an undocked tail. The tail of a boxer is typically docked before the cartilage is fully formed, from 3\u20135 days old. The procedure does not require any sutures when performed at this young age, and anesthesia is not used. The docking of the tail is not permitted under the breed standard of The Kennel Club UK.,The Boxer is a short-haired breed, with a smooth coat that lies tight to the body. The recognized colors are fawn and brindle, frequently with a white underbelly and white on the feet. These white markings, called \"flash\", often extend onto the neck or face, and dogs that have these markings are known as \"flashy\". \"Fawn\" denotes a range of colors, the tones of which may be described variously as light tan or yellow, reddish tan, mahogany, or stag/deer red, and dark honey-blonde. In the UK and Europe, fawn Boxers are typically rich in color and are often called \"red\". \"Brindle\" refers to a dog with black stripes on a fawn background. Some brindle Boxers are so heavily striped that they give the appearance of \"reverse brindling\", fawn stripes on a black body; these dogs are conventionally called \"reverse brindles\", but that is actually a misnomer\u2014they are still fawn dogs with black stripes. In addition, the breed standards state that the fawn background must clearly contrast with or show through the brindling.,The Boxer does not carry the gene for a solid black coat color, so purebred black Boxers do not exist." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5cf" }, "breed": "Bracco Italiano", "origin": "Italy", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracco_Italiano", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Giotto_BI.jpg/220px-Giotto_BI.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c72d" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/bracco_italiano.jpg", "good_with_children": 4, "good_with_other_dogs": 4, "shedding": 2, "grooming": 1, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 5, "energy": 4, "barking": 2, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 14, "max_height_male": 27, "max_height_female": 27, "max_weight_male": 90, "max_weight_female": 90, "min_height_male": 21, "min_height_female": 21, "min_weight_male": 55, "min_weight_female": 55, "breed": "Bracco Italiano" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e2f" }, "breed": "Bracco Italiano", "contenido": "The Bracco Italiano is an Italian breed of pointing dog.,The first dog registered by the Kennel Club Italiano, founded in 1882, was a Bracco Italiano.

The breed was developed in the United States Chesapeake Bay area during the 19th century. Historically used by area market hunters to retrieve waterfowl, pull fishing nets, and rescue fishermen, it is today primarily a family pet and hunting companion. They are often known for their love of water and their ability to hunt.  It is a medium to large sized dog similar in appearance to the Labrador Retriever. The Chesapeake has a wavy coat, rather than the Labrador's smooth coat. They are described as having a bright and happy disposition, courage, willingness to work, alertness, intelligence, and love of water as some of their characteristics.,Distinctive features include eyes that are very clear, of yellowish or amber hue, hindquarters as high or a trifle higher than the shoulders, and a double-coat that tends to wave on shoulders, neck, back, and loins. The waterproof coat feels slightly oily and is often associated with a slight musky odor. Three basic colors are generally seen in the breed: brown, which includes all shades from a light to a deep dark brown; sedge, which varies from a reddish yellow through a bright red to chestnut shades; and deadgrass in all its shades, varying from a faded tan to a dull straw color. The breed standard states that white may also appear but it must be limited to the breast, belly, toes, or back of the feet. The head is round and broad with a medium stop and muzzle. The lips are thin, and the ears are small and of medium leather. The forelegs should be straight with good bone. The hindquarters are especially strong and the toes webbed since excellent swimming ability is important for the Chesapeake. This breed is also known for its large and powerful chest, used to break apart ice when diving into cold water while duck hunting.,The coat of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever is given the most consideration of any trait listed on the Positive Scale of Points in the Breed Standard. However the AKC Standard also reads \"The question of coat and general type of balance takes precedence over any scoring table which could be drawn up. The Chesapeake should be well proportioned, an animal with a good coat and well balanced in other points being preferable to one excelling in some but weak in others.\" The hair on the face and legs should be very short and straight with a tendency to wave, never curl, on the shoulders, neck, back, and loins only and nowhere over 1.5 inches long. Moderate feathering on the rear of the hindquarters and tail is permissible although not longer than 1.75 inches long.,The texture of the thick double-coat is important in protecting the dog from cold water and icy conditions. The oil in the harsh outer coat and woolly undercoat resists water, keeping the dog dry and warm. Maintenance of the coat is minimal and mainly consists of brushing with a short-tooth brush once a week. It is difficult to get a Chesapeake Bay Retriever thoroughly wet, but they should be bathed every 3\u20134 months using a suitably mild shampoo, then dried thoroughly. Brushing or bathing more often can ruin the texture since it strips the protective oil from the coat and may even remove the undercoat.  The color of the coat must be similar to the working surroundings. Any color of brown, sedge or deadgrass is acceptable and one color is not preferred over another. The American Chesapeake Club includes a discussion on color:,Three basic colors are generally seen in the breed: Brown which includes all shades from a light cocoa (a silvered brown) to a deep bittersweet chocolate color; sedge which varies from a reddish yellow through a bright red to chestnut shades; deadgrass which takes in all shades of deadgrass, varying from a faded tan to a dull straw color. Historic records show that some of the deadgrass shades can be very light, almost white in appearance, while darker deadgrass colors can include diluted shades of brown called ash, that appear as either gray or taupe. The almost white and ash/taupe/gray shades are not commonly seen, but are acceptable.The difference between a sedge and a deadgrass is that the deadgrass shades contain no significant amount of red, while the sedge shades do have red. Coat and texture also play a factor in the perception of color. The self-color pattern is preferred by the standard (One color with or without lighter and darker shadings of the same color). You will see dogs with varying degrees of other markings such as: masking on top of the skull, striping effect of light & dark through the body and on legs, distinct & indistinct saddle markings, agouti coloring and tan points. All are acceptable, they are just not preferred.A white spot on the breast (not extending above the sternum), belly, toes or back of the feet is permissible, but the smaller the spot the better. White beyond these areas and black anywhere on the body is not allowed in the breed standard." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5e6" }, "breed": "Coton de Tulear", "origin": "Madagascar", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coton_de_Tulear", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Coton_de_Tular_1.jpg/220px-Coton_de_Tular_1.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c735" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/coton_de_tulear.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 5, "shedding": 2, "grooming": 4, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 5, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 4, "energy": 3, "barking": 1, "min_life_expectancy": 15, "max_life_expectancy": 19, "max_height_male": 11, "max_height_female": 11, "max_weight_male": 15, "max_weight_female": 13, "min_height_male": 10, "min_height_female": 10, "min_weight_male": 9, "min_weight_female": 8, "breed": "Coton de Tulear" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e71" }, "breed": "Coton de Tulear", "contenido": "The Coton de Tul\u00e9ar is a breed of small dog named for the city of Tul\u00e9ar (also known as Toliara) in Madagascar. This breed is thought to have originated from a group of small white dogs that swam across the Malagasy channel following a shipwreck. Known for its cotton-like coat, the Coton de Tul\u00e9ar typically grows to no more than 18 pounds (8.2 kg), and are white, sometimes with grey, tan, black, or tri-colored markings. The Coton de Tul\u00e9ar Day is celebrated on November 26th. ,Multiple registries with differing standards describe the Coton de Tul\u00e9ar, but it generally has very soft voluptuous hair (as opposed to fur), comparable to a cotton ball (hence its name in French, coton meaning cotton), a prominent black nose, large expressive eyes (usually covered by bangs), and somewhat short legs. The Coton de Tul\u00e9ar's tail should curl over its back.,The Coton de Tul\u00e9ar has a medium-to-long, fluffy, cotton-like coat that is considered hair rather than fur. It is a non-shedding breed with low dander and is considered hypoallergenic. When it is a puppy, it may shed its puppy coat. Like the poodles, Maltese or the Havanese, this breed has very low allergic effects. Matted hair is common for this breed and should be removed through daily brushing and combing. Grooming the Coton de Tulear can be quite a challenge.,The Coton de Tul\u00e9ar comes in three accepted colors: white (sometimes with tan markings; all white is preferred by show breeders); black and white; and tricolor. However, the tan and white may become all white, the blacks will often fade to grey or white, and fur will most likely change throughout puppyhood. The breed even has a fade gene that causes the colors, which are very dark when a puppy, to fade and turn white at the base of the hair as it lengthens; that is why the Champagne or Champagne Teddy Bear Coton eventually turns white when the adult hair comes in.) The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale standard specifies that the Coton's coat should be white but may also have tan or \"lemon\" color on their ears and body. The coat, however, must be primarily white with no black hair. The US-based Coton de Tulear Club of America allows for three different but equally favorable colorings: white, black-and-white, and tri-color, including \"honey bear\". White is described as nearly all white, sometimes with tan or champagne coloring on the ears, face, or back. Black-and-white is defined as pure white with prominent black patches on the head and body (no white-to-black ratio is specified or favored). Tri-color is described as mostly white with some brown markings and dustings of black on the body and head. A honey bear tri-color has light brown with black tips that gradually fades to an off-white or lemon color. The tri-color loses the most color of any of the color varieties, usually becoming mostly white with possibly some champagne markings and a dusting of black hairs on the ears and/or body." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5e7" }, "breed": "Cretan Hound", "origin": "Greece (Crete)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretan_Hound", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Kritikosichnilatis_1.jpg/220px-Kritikosichnilatis_1.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e72" }, "breed": "Cretan Hound", "contenido": "The Kritikos Lagonikos (Cretan Hound) (Greek:K\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u039b\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2) is a breed of dog from the island of Crete, in Greece. The Cretan Hound is recognized both in Greece and in Germany. The breed is also considered to be the oldest European dog breed dating to perhaps before 3200 BCE and Neolithic times. ,The Cretan Hound is a slender dog, somewhere between a scenthound and a sighthound in body, particularly light on its feet (that are oval rather than cat-like) and strong in loin, specially adopted for swift reflexes and high speed over dangerous, rocky terrain. The head is wedge-shaped, elongated and dry, with pricked and very mobile ears that fold backwards. The tail is a key breed characteristic, long and curved upwards, forming a loose or tight ring and covered with a brush of longer hair underneath.,The dog is slightly longer than tall, with medium angulations, slender legs and muscle. The loin is slender yet powerful and there is tuck-up, with the points of the hipbones slightly prominent. The breed has a balance between characteristics of speed and stamina, the conformation being a compromise producing great agility.,The breed can range in colour between pure white, cream, sandy, fawn, grey, black or brindle, bi-colored or tri-colored.,The males of the breed can be 21 to 23 inches (54-58cm tolerance 2cm) and the females 20 to 22.8 inches (52-56cm tolerance 2cm).

It is sometimes called the Irish Glen of Imaal Terrier or the Wicklow Terrier, and the name of the breed is often shortened by fanciers to just Glen.,The breed originates in, and is named for, the Glen of Imaal in County Wicklow, Ireland. It was recognised first by the Irish Kennel Club in 1934 and most recently by the American Kennel Club in 2004. The Canadian Kennel Club voted to fully recognize Glens in 2017 after the breed spent years on the Miscellaneous list; approval by Agriculture Canada is pending.,Reportedly, the Glen's history began during the reign of Elizabeth I, who hired French and Hessian mercenaries to put down a rebellion in Ireland. After the conflict, many of these soldiers settled in the Wicklow area. They brought with them their low-slung hounds, which they bred with the local terrier stock, eventually developing a distinctive breed that became known as the Glen of Imaal Terrier.Glens were originally used for eradicating other animals such as rat, fox, badger, and otter, and also as a general-purpose farm dog for herding and family companionship. Unlike many other terriers, they are \"strong dogs\" rather than \"sounders\"\u2014they were bred to work mute to ground, going silently into dens after their quarry rather than barking at it to alert their handlers. In hunting trials, which used to be required by many kennel clubs for championships, Glens were disqualified if they sounded at the quarry. For this reason, today they are among the quietest terriers.,According to Irish lore, Glen of Imaal Terriers were also used as turnspit dogs to turn meat over fires for cooking. Evidence for this is scarce, and engravings of such dogs from the 19th century do not bear much resemblance to today's Glen. It is, however, repeated in many descriptions of the breed and often used in color commentary by dog show announcers.The breed almost died out before being revived in the early twentieth century by breeders in its homeland. Paddy Brennan Tinahely Co Wicklow, and Willie Kane Tipperary are recognised as two breeders that revived the breed. Today, the Glen of Imaal Terrier is still one of the rarest breeds of dog (in the US, living registered animals number in the hundreds) and the least-known Irish terrier breed. It is considered a vulnerable native breed by the UK's Kennel Club, which tracks breeds in which fewer than 300 puppies are registered each year.[1],A \"big dog on short legs,\" the Glen of Imaal Terrier is an achondroplastic dwarf breed. It is more substantial than might be expected from photographs; a typical adult Glen weighs about 36 pounds and stands 14\" tall at the withers. The AKC breed standard specifies a height of 12\" to 14\" and a weight of \"approximately\" 35 pounds for males and \"somewhat less\" for females, with a length-to-height ratio of 5:3. Many champion Glens are larger than breed standard, with some individuals exceeding 40 or even 45 pounds. With three growth stages, a Glen can take up to four years to reach full maturity.,Glens have a large head, with rose or half-prick ears; short, bowed legs; and a straight topline that rises slightly toward the tail. The shoulders, chest, and hips are sturdy and muscular (the AKC breed standard specifies an impression of \"maximum substance for size\") and the front feet are turned out. The breed is considered unrefined, with antique features that were common in early terriers but which have since fallen out of favor with fanciers and breeders.,On their back, Glens have a unique double coat that is wiry with a soft undercoat. The head, sides, and legs have only the softer coat, which typically develops a degree of waviness. The color of the coat may be wheaten or blue (the latter usually with brindling), with both wheaten and blue encompassing a range of shades. Other colorings do occasionally occur in Glens (including a mixture of wheaten and blue referred to as \"grizzle\" and a \"blue and tan\" that is blue on top with wheaten furnishings) but these rare variations, while not disqualifications, are not favored by fanciers.  ,Wheaten Glen of Imaal puppies often have black highlights in their fur, and when young may show a \"dorsal stripe\" of darker fur down the middle of their backs, but this usually does not appear in their adult coat.,The Glen of Imaal terrier does not molt or shed much, and needs to be brushed or combed every week or two to keep the soft coat in good condition and free of matting. It is also typical to strip excess hair from the hard coat two to four times per year; this \"dead\" hair pulls out easily and painlessly with the proper tools.,Although some extra grooming is needed for showing (for example, the light-colored soft undercoat is often \"carded\" from the back to enhance the color of the darker wiry coat), the Glen is intended to have a \"rough and ready\" appearance, and show grooming requires less effort than in many other breeds. Glens should look tidy but natural, never manicured or clipped, in the conformation ring.,Historically, the breed's tail was typically docked to a length just sufficient to serve as a handhold for pulling the dog out of a badger hole. Docking is still standard in the United States, though some breeders have stopped doing it, and an intact tail is not a fault in AKC conformation showing. Many countries, however, ban docking for showing completely. Ireland has banned showing of dogs whose tails were docked on or after March 6, 2014 (the procedure is also itself illegal with very limited exceptions). In the UK, working terriers can still be shown with docked tails, but dogs kept as pets cannot." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5fc" }, "breed": "Kanni", "origin": "India", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanni", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Kanni.jpg/220px-Kanni.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ef5" }, "breed": "Kanni", "contenido": "The Kanni (\u0b95\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0ba9\u0bbf), meaning pure, (also known as the Maiden's Beastmaster) is a rare indigenous South Indian sighthound breed of dog found in the state of Tamil Nadu. Their native breeding tract is located around villages in the Tirunelveli, Virudhunagar and Thoothukudi districts. The breed is used mainly for coursing. \"Kanni\" refers to the black and tan and black and sable varieties, while the variety which is one colour is known as the Chippiparai.

This led to the wrong naming of the black and tan coloured breeds as Kanni in dogs as well as goats in future.

Once considered to be a separate species in its own right, under the name Canis hallstromi, it is closely related to the Australian dingo. The dog has a reputation for its unique vocalization.,In 1989 the Australian mammalogist Tim Flannery took a photo of a black-and-tan dog in Telefomin District. He wrote that these dogs live with native people in the mountains, and that feral populations lived in the alpine and sub-alpine grasslands of the Star Mountains and the Wharton Range. The photo was published in his book Mammals of New Guinea. In 2012 Australian wilderness-adventure guide Tom Hewett took a photo of a tawny, thick-coated dog in the Puncak Mandala region of West Papua, Indonesia. In 2016 a literature review found no definitive evidence that the founding members of captive populations of New Guinea singing dogs were wild-living animals; they were raised as members of village populations of domestic dogs.,In 1999, a study of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) indicated that the domestic dog may have originated from multiple grey wolf populations, with the dingo and New Guinea singing dog \"breeds\" having developed at a time when human populations were more isolated from each other. In the third edition of Mammal Species of the World published in 2005, the mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed under the wolf Canis lupus its wild subspecies, and proposed two additional subspecies: \"familiaris Linnaeus, 1758 [domestic dog]\" and \"dingo Meyer, 1793 [domestic dog]\". Wozencraft included hallstromi \u2013 the New Guinea singing dog \u2013 as a taxonomic synonym for the dingo. Wozencraft referred to the mtDNA study as one of the guides in forming his decision. The inclusion of familiaris and dingo under a \"domestic dog\" clade has been noted by other mammalogists. This classification by Wozencraft is debated among zoologists.The New Guinea singing dog's taxonomic status is debated, with proposals that include treating it within the species concept (range of variation) of the domestic dog Canis familiaris, a distinct species Canis hallstromi, and Canis lupus dingo when considered a subspecies of the wolf. In 2019, a workshop hosted by the IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group considered the New Guinea singing dog and the dingo to be feral dogs Canis familiaris, and therefore should not be assessed for the IUCN Red List.,During the Torres expedition to the south coast of New Guinea and the Torres Strait in 1606, small dogs were recorded by Captain Don Diego de Prado y Tovar:,We found small dumb dogs that neither bark nor howl, and do not cry out even if beaten with sticks,On 26 October 1897, the Lieutenant-Governor of British New Guinea, Sir William MacGregor, was on Mount Scratchley, Central Province, Papua New Guinea.

The dogs were known in German as Rottweiler Metzgerhund, meaning Rottweil butchers' dogs, because their main use was to herd livestock and pull carts laden with butchered meat to market. This continued until the mid-19th century when railways replaced droving. Although still used to herd stock in many parts of the world, Rottweilers are now also used as search and rescue dogs, guard dogs, and police dogs.,According to the FCI Standard, the Rottweiler is considered to be one of the oldest dog breeds. Its origin goes back to Roman times. These dogs were kept as herder or driving dogs. They marched over the Alps with the Roman legions, protecting the humans and driving their cattle. In the region of Rottweil, these dogs met and mixed with the native dogs in a natural crossing. The main task of the Rottweiler now became the driving and guarding of the herds of cattle and the defence of their masters and their property. This breed acquired its name from the old free city of Rottweil and was known as the \"Rottweil butcher's dog\". The butchers bred this type of dog purely for performance and usefulness. In due course, a first rate watch and driving dog evolved which could also be used as a draught dog.The buildup to World War I saw a great demand for police dogs, which led to a revival of interest in the Rottweiler. During the First and Second World Wars, Rottweilers saw service in various roles, including as messenger, ambulance, draught, and guard dogs.,The Deutscher Rottweiler-Klub (DRK, German Rottweiler Club), the first Rottweiler club in Germany, was founded on 13 January 1914, and followed by the creation of the S\u00fcddeutscher Rottweiler-Klub (SDRK, South German Rottweiler Club) on 27 April 1915 and eventually became the IRK (International Rottweiler Club). The DRK counted around 500 Rottweilers, and the SDRK 3,000 Rottweilers. The goals of the two clubs were different. The DRK aimed to produce working dogs and did not emphasise the morphology of the Rottweiler.,The various German Rottweiler Clubs amalgamated to form the Allgemeiner Deutscher Rottweiler Klub (ADRK, General German Rottweiler Club) in 1921. This was officially recorded in the register of clubs and associations at the district court of Stuttgart on 27 January 1924. The ADRK is recognised worldwide as the home club of the Rottweiler.,In 1931, the Rottweiler was officially recognised by the American Kennel Club. In 1936, Rottweilers were exhibited in Britain at Crufts. In 1966, a separate register was opened for the breed. In fact, in the mid-1990s, the popularity of the Rottweiler reached an all-time high, with it being the most registered dog by the American Kennel Club. In 2017, the American Kennel Club ranked the Rottweiler as the eighth-most popular purebred dog in the United States.,The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale gives the following description of the Rottweiler standard: \"Rottweiler breeders aim at a dog of abundant strength, black coated with clearly defined rich tan markings, whose powerful appearance does not lack nobility and which is exceptionally well suited to being a companion, service, rescue and working dog.\" This breed is all about balance, endurance, proportionality, intelligence and strength.

In the early 1980s, Yoshio Aragaki the founder of the Ryukyu dog Hozonkai, felt a strong urge to save the breed when he managed to find purebred Ryukyu dog up in Yanbaru.  ,It is believed that the years of living in the rainforest is why the Ryukyu dog has a dewclaw on the back of the foot. Because of this claw, they can climb trees. It has been speculated that this would have been evolutionarily favourable to them because of the high incidence of tsunami in Okinawa; they could climb trees quickly to evade the floods. However, this is unlikely to be true due to only a small percentage of Ryukyu dog actually having working rear dewclaws.

They are small dogs, on average growing to heights of between 25 and 30 centimeters tall. ,The origin of the Tenterfield Terrier is not known. It is said that the Tenterfield Terrier breed originated from dogs that accompanied Australia's first European settlers who sailed from Portsmouth in the south of England. These dogs were pest and vermin killers, with the smallest of them selected to play that role on the European ships, thus leading to their arrival in Australia. It is also said that the smallest puppies from the litters of Fox Terriers were sometimes domestically selected such as for manouvreability in a hunting role, and even  at times crossed with other small breeds to achieve a smaller size.By the late 19th century a dog type known as the Miniature Fox Terrier (known colloquially as \"Mini Foxies\") was well established in rural Australia as a vermin killer and family companion. By the 1920s the dog had become a fixture in urban households.The name \"Tenterfield\" is sometimes incorrectly stated to denote the breed's place of origin. Rather, it may have derived from a well known breeder. The dog was bred extensively in and around northern New South Wales. Tenterfield is one of many localities in Australia in which small terriers of this type were kept. The town of Tenterfield is significant in Australian history for the Tenterfield Oration on independence from Britain. Additionally, the owner of the town's saddlery a man named George Woolnough, was immortalized by his grandson entertainer Peter Allen as the \"Tenterfield Saddler\".  Tenterfield residents attest that Mr. Woolnough  owned and loved a number of these terriers, however, photographs of these dogs have not yet been discovered. ,The name Tenterfield Terrier was suggested in the 1990s by television gardening personality Don Burke, and was adopted during the renaming of one of the then-Miniature Fox Terrier clubs.,Tenterfield Terriers are fairly healthy breeds of dog, however they are prone to hypothyroidism and patellar luxation, as well as a tendency to become overweight if fed too often.

Similar to other strains of Polynesian dogs, it was introduced to the Marquesas by the ancestors of the Polynesian people during their migrations. Serving as a tribal totems and religious symbols, they were sometimes consumed as meat although less frequently than in other parts of the Pacific because of their scarcity. These native dogs are thought to have become extinct before the arrival of Europeans, who did not record their presence on the islands. Petroglyphic representations of dogs and the archaeological remains of dog bones and burials are the only evidence that the breed ever existed. Modern dog population on the island are the descendants of foreign breeds later reintroduced in the 19th century as companions for European settlers. ,There are two words in the Marquesan language for dog: peto, used in the Northern Marquesas, and nuhe, used in the Southern Marquesas. The former might have been an English loanword from pet or a Spanish loanword from perro (dog), although pero was an alternative for dog (kur\u012b) in the related M\u0101ori language. According to another theory supporting its foreign origin, the name came from a New Haven dog named Pato left on Nuku Hiva by the American sea captain Edmund Fanning from 1798 to 1803. The South Marquesan Nuhe is unique in the Polynesian languages, but may have some connection to wanuhe, the word for dog in the Papuan language of the Brumer Islands. French Catholic missionary Ren\u00e9-Ildefonse Dordillon listed two other forms: moho\u02bbio and mohokio in his 1904 dictionary Grammaire et dictionnaire de la langue des iles Marquises.,Little is known about the Marquesan Dog. They were introduced to the Marquesan Islands by the original Polynesian settlers along with domesticated chickens, pigs, and the Polynesian rat. The dog is thought to have become extinct prior to the arrival of Spanish explorers in 1595, although some might have survived beyond this point.,No European accounts were ever written about them. They were thought to be fairly rare and \"never numerous in the islands\" even before the arrival of Europeans. Unlike in other parts of Polynesia, dogs were not considered an important food source, although they were sometimes eaten as shown by the presence of cut marks on dog bones found in archaeological excavations. Due to their rarity, they were venerated by the Marquesans and were closely associated with the high chiefs and priestly classes.Many petroglyphs or carved images of dogs were found near religious centers and chiefly residential areas indicating their venerated status and importance in the culture. A survey by American archaeologist Sidsel N.

It is characterised by a gentle and affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most frequently registered breeds in several Western countries. It is a frequent competitor in dog shows and obedience trials; it is also used as a gundog, and may be trained for use as a guide dog.,The breed was created by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate Guisachan in the late nineteenth century. He cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with some further infusions of Red Setter, Labrador Retriever and Bloodhound. The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1913, and during the interwar period spread to many parts of the world.,The Golden Retriever was developed in Scotland in the nineteenth century by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks (later to become Baron Tweedmouth) from Flat-coated Retrievers judiciously crossed with Tweed Water Spaniels and some other British dog breeds. Prior to the 1952 publication of the very detailed stud book which had been meticulously maintained by Marjoribanks, a number of romantic tales were published about the origins of the breed.In the 1860s Marjoribanks set out to create what to his mind was the ultimate breed of retriever at his Scottish estate Guisachan. He started by acquiring a yellow-coloured Flat-coated Retriever dog called Nous; Nous had been whelped in June 1864 and was the only yellow pup in an otherwise all black-coloured litter. Whilst uncommon, occasionally liver, brown, golden or yellow-coloured purebred Flat-coated Retriever pups are whelped to matings of two black parents. It is the pedigree of Nous that was the source for the romantic tales of the heritage of the Golden Retriever. One early account claimed Nous was purchased from a Russian circus trainer in Brighton, another claimed he was bought from a cobbler, and yet another claimed a gypsy. The stud book states that Nous was a Flat-coated Retriever bred by Lord Chichester on his Stanmer Park estate near Brighton.In 1868 Nous was mated to a Tweed Water Spaniel bitch named Belle, who is recorded in the stud book as being whelped in 1863 and being of \"Ladykirk breeding\". The litter from this mating consisted of four yellow pups, Primrose, Ada, Cowslip and Crocus. The best bitch from this litter, Cowslip, was mated to a Tweed Water Spaniel called Tweed with the mating producing a bitch pup called Topsy. Cowslip was subsequently mated to a Red Setter called Sampson, that mating produced a dog pup called Jack. Topsy was mated with a black Flat-coated Retriever called Sambo and a bitch pup from that litter, Zoe, was mated back to Jack and two pups from that mating were retained, a dog called Nous II and a bitch called Gill. Gill was mated to a black Labrador Retriever called Tracer, and a bitch pup from that mating, Queenie, was mated back to Nous II; all Golden Retrievers descend from this mating. The progeny from these various matings varied in colour from pure black to light cream, but it was the golden coloured ones that were retained and mated to each other, forming the foundation stock of the Golden Retriever breed. Marjoribanks is also known to have used a sandy-coloured Bloodhound and another Labrador in subsequent years of the breeding program.,In 1952 Marjoribanks's great-nephew, Giles Fox-Strangways, 6th Earl of Ilchester, teamed up with Elma Stonex and together they studied Marjoribanks's stud book. In 1960 their research was published, presenting all of the evidence required to counter all tales of Russian ancestry. The stud book, which covers the period from 1868 to 1890, is preserved in the library of the Kennel Club in London.,In the early days Golden Retrievers were called the 'Flat-coated Retriever, Golden', initially the Golden Retriever was considered a colour variety of the former breed. In 1903 the Kennel Club recorded the first examples, listing them in the same register as Flat-coats. In 1904 a Golden Retriever won a field trial and in 1908 the first examples were exhibited at conformation shows. In 1911 a breed club was formed for the breed in England, the Golden Retriever Club, and they were given a new name, the 'Yellow or Golden Retriever'; from this point they were increasingly seen as a separate breed from the Flat-coated Retriever. It was not until 1913 that the Kennel Club began recording them on a separate breed register from the Flat-coated Retriever and in 1920 the 'Yellow or' was dropped from the breed name and they were officially called the 'Golden Retriever'.One early twentieth century enthusiast of the breed, Winifred Charlesworth, was instrumental in the establishment of the breed club as well as its separate Kennel Club recognition. It was she who drew up the first breed standard, which was adopted by the Kennel Club and with only minor amendments and remains largely unchanged. She bred and exhibited the first Golden Retriever Show Champion, was a strong advocate for maintaining the working instincts of the breed, and she is credited with popularising it at field trials and introducing it to shooting sportsmen.In the years after the First World War its popularity increased markedly and in the 1920s and 1930s it spread through much of the Western world. The Canadian Kennel Club recognised the breed in 1927, the American Kennel Club in 1932; the first examples were registered in France in 1934 and Australia in 1937. The worldwide popularity of the breed meant it did not suffer the misfortunes many British dog breeds did during the Second World War due to British wartime restrictions on the breeding of larger dogs, with ample quality breeding stock available globally to ensure none of its characteristics were lost.Since the 1940s its popularity has continued to grow, and it has become one of the most recognised and most frequently registered dog breeds in the Western world." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c623" }, "breed": "Tesem", "origin": "Egypt", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesem", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Tesem_couple.png/220px-Tesem_couple.png", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fdb" }, "breed": "Tesem", "contenido": "Tesem (Ancient Egyptian: \u1e6fzm, tjezem; ) was the ancient Egyptian name for \"hunting dog\". In popular literature it denotes the prick-eared, leggy dog with a curled tail from the early Egyptian age, but it was also used with reference to the lop-eared \"Saluki/Sloughi\" type. It was one of several types of dogs in Ancient Egypt; particularly the latter Saluki/Sloughi type of Tesem, having the appearance most similar to that of a true sighthound.,Three main types of dogs are shown in Ancient Egypt, these being the pariah dog, the greyhound-like dog and a mastiff-type dog. It is assumed that there were two types of greyhound-like breeds, these being the older Tesem and the Saluki/Sloughi type.  The two greyhound-types were clearly distinguished in tomb decorations, with the Tesem thought to be similar to modern pariah dogs. One scholar applies the name Tesem to both types of greyhound-like dogs.The prick-eared Tesem's origins are presumed to be from further south than Egypt, from Nubia and also the Land of Punt, whose location is unclear but thought to be to the southeast of Egypt on the Horn of Africa.A drawing of a Tesem-type dog appears in Nagada, dated from the Protodynastic Period of Egypt (dated 3200 BC to 3000 BC). The dogs were drawn with upright ears and a tightly curled tail. One of the earliest known recordings of these dogs is the \"Khufu dog\" from the tomb of Pharaoh Khufu, who reigned between 2609\u20132584 BC.  This dog was named Akbaru, and was depicted wearing a collar.They continued to appear during the Middle Kingdom period (2055 BC and 1650 BC), but by the time of the New Kingdom (1550 BC - 1069 BC), they were replaced by dogs with hanging ears and a straight tail. These dogs were of the Saluki/Sloughi type.The Pharaoh Hound of Malta and the Cirneco dell'Etna of Sicily were both popularly and controversially thought to be possible descendants of the Tesem.,Ancient Egyptians gave the name Tesem to the early curly-tailed dogs that resembled a sighthound. These dogs were featured on monumentsand in wall paintings that showed their lean body with noticeable prick ears. They had a greyish-yellow coat, with long legs and a broad prominent forehead. Their size exceeded the pariah dogs of the time. The structure of their skeleton was closer to that the modern terrier than that of the modern greyhound.,Africanis,Set animal" }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c624" }, "breed": "American bully", "origin": "United States", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_bully", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Champion_Charlie_Muscles_%282%29.jpg/220px-Champion_Charlie_Muscles_%282%29.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5df1" }, "breed": "American bully", "contenido": "The American Bully is a modern breed of dog that was developed as a companion dog, and originally standardized and recognized as a breed in 2004 by the American Bully Kennel Club (ABKC). Their published breed standard basically describes the dog as giving the \"impression of great strength for its size.\"  In 2008, the American Bully was recognized by the European Bully Kennel Club (EBKC), and on July 15, 2013, by the United Kennel Club (UKC).  Neither The Kennel Club nor American Kennel Club (AKC) have recognized or accepted the American Bully into their registry as a purebred dog. The founding registry (ABKC) divided the American Bully into four categories, including the Pocket, Standard, Classic, and XL, whereas other registries, including the UKC, have approved one consistent size standard.,The American Bully, as it is now known, began development in the 1980s with the majority of the final behavioral and aesthetic product being completed in the 1990s. There is consensus that at least five other breeds were used to attain the more \"bully\" physical traits desired as well as the more diminutive size of some lines. The American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT) was the foundation (parent breed) used to create the American Bully. The APBT has maintained a characteristic appearance and temperament for over a century. Within that span of time different strains of APBT emerged within the breed, each with different physical attributes. One particular APBT strain developed a specific, stockier, physique that warranted recognition as a different breed altogether. The bloodline of this APBT strain was then influenced with the introduction of American Bulldog, English Bulldog, and Olde English Bulldogge in order to fine-tune desired physical characteristics and personality traits.The breed was first recognized by its breed club, the American Bully Kennel Club (ABKC), in 2004. This registry first acted as a means to document pedigrees and show the breed against its written standard. According to the ABKC the initial desire for this breed was to produce a dog with a lower prey drive and more of the \"bully\" traits and characteristics than the American Staffordshire Terrier. Mass and heavy bone was prioritized to ensure such a look, and due to this many of the dogs shown today display the wide front for which they were originally bred.The breed's development and popularity are commonly tied to the growth of hip-hop culture. The American Bully should not be confused with the several other bulldog-type breeds.,Within the ABKC, the four varieties are separated by height without specification of weight. All these varieties are expected to follow the same standard with minor alterations.All dogs are classified and shown as Standard until they reach a year of age, at which point they are separated into the varieties and shown against their own type.,The standard American Bully type is a medium-sized dog with a compact bulky muscular body, heavy bone structure and blocky head. Male dogs must be 17 to 20 in (43 to 51 cm), while females must be 16 to 19 in (41 to 48 cm)." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c625" }, "breed": "American Pit Bull Terrier", "origin": "United States", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Pit_Bull_Terrier", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/000_American_Pit_Bull_Terrier.jpg/220px-000_American_Pit_Bull_Terrier.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5dee" }, "breed": "American Pit Bull Terrier", "contenido": "The American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT) is a dog breed recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) and the American Dog Breeders Association (ADBA), but not the American Kennel Club (AKC). It is a medium-sized, intelligent, short-haired dog, of a solid build, whose early ancestors came from the British Isles. When compared with the English Staffordshire Bull Terrier, the American Pit Bull Terrier is larger by margins of 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm) in height and 25\u201335 pounds (11\u201316 kg) in weight. The American Pit Bull Terrier varies in size: males are normally about 18\u201321 inches (45\u201353 cm) in height and around 35\u201360 pounds (15\u201327 kg) in weight, while females are normally around 17\u201320 inches (43\u201350 cm) in height and 30\u201350 pounds (13\u201322 kg) in weight.According to the ADBA, the American Pit Bull is described to be medium-sized and has a short coat and smooth well-defined muscle structure, and its eyes are to be round to almond-shaped, and its ears are to be small to medium in length, typically half prick or rose in carriage. The tail is prescribed to be slightly thick and tapering to a point. The coat is required by the ADBA to be glossy, smooth, short, and stiff to the touch. Many colors, color patterns, and combinations of colors are acceptable to the ADBA, except that both the ADBA and UKC do not recognize merle coloring. Color patterns that are typical in the breed are solid and tuxedo.Despite the colloquial use of the term \"pit bull\" to encompass a whole category of dogs and the legal use of the term to include several breeds in legislation, some conservative professional breeders of the American Pit Bull Terrier as well as some experts and supporters claim that historically the APBT is the only true \"pit bull\" and the only breed that should be denominated as such.Twelve countries in Europe, as well as Australia, Canada, some parts of the United States, Ecuador, Malaysia, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore, and Venezuela, have enacted some form of breed-specific legislation on pit bull\u2013type dogs, including American Pit Bull Terriers, ranging from outright bans to restrictions and conditions on ownership. Several states in Australia place restrictions on the breed, including mandatory sterilization. The breed is banned in the United Kingdom, in the Canadian province of Ontario, and in many locations in the United States. ,Until the mid-19th century the now extinct Old English Terriers and Old English Bulldogs were bred together to produce a dog that combined the gameness of the terrier with the strength and athleticism of the bulldog. This type of dog, which was bred in the British Isles, became known as the bull and terrier. These dogs arrived in the United States in the late nineteenth century where they became the direct ancestors of the American Pit Bull Terrier.In the United Kingdom, Bull-and-terriers were used in bloodsports such as bull baiting and bear baiting. These bloodsports were officially eliminated in 1835 when Britain introduced animal welfare laws. Since dog fighting is cheaper to organize and far easier to conceal from the law than bull or bear baits, bloodsport proponents turned to pitting their dogs against each other instead. Dog fighting was used as both a bloodsport (often involving gambling) and a way to continue to test the quality of their stock. For decades afterwards, dog fighting clandestinely took place in small areas of Britain. These dogs arrived in America around 1845 to 1860, where the dog fighting practice had continuity. On February 10, 1898, the breed was recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) named as American Pit Bull Terrier.For some time in the early part of the 20th century the UKC began to register the breed name with the word \"pit\" in parentheses (American (Pit) Bull Terrier), to facilitate public acceptance as an American Bull Terrier. However this only lasted a short time and returned to the previous form.In the early 20th century, pit bulls were used as catch dogs in America for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to hunt hogs, and drive livestock, and as family companions.Pit Bull Terriers successfully fill the role of companion dogs, working dogs, athletic sport dogs (Weight pulling, French Ring Sport, Top Dog), police dogs, and therapy dogs. Pit Bull Terriers also constitute the majority of dogs used for illegal dog fighting in America In addition, law enforcement organizations report these dogs are used for other nefarious purposes, such as guarding illegal narcotics operations, use against police, and as attack dogs.In an effort to counter the fighting reputation of pit bull\u2013type dogs, in 1996 the San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals renamed pit bull terriers \"St. Francis Terriers\", hoping that people would be more likely to adopt them. 60 temperament-screened dogs were adopted until the program was halted, after several of the newly adopted pit bulls killed cats. The New York City Center for Animal Care and Control tried a similar approach in 2004, relabeling their pit bulls as \"New Yorkies\", but dropped the idea in the face of overwhelming public opposition.,The UKC gives this description of the characteristic of the American Pit Bull dog: \"The essential characteristics of the American Pit Bull Terrier are strength, confidence, and zest for life. This breed is eager to please and brimming over with enthusiasm. APBTs make excellent family companions and have always been noted for their love of children. Because most APBTs exhibit some level of dog aggression and because of its powerful physique, the APBT requires an owner who will carefully socialize and obedience train the dog. The breed's natural agility makes it one of the most capable canine climbers so good fencing is a must for this breed. The APBT is not the best choice for a guard dog since they are extremely friendly, even with strangers. Aggressive behavior toward humans is uncharacteristic of the breed and highly undesirable. This breed does very well in performance events because of its high level of intelligence and its willingness to work.The standard imposed by the ADBA and Old Family Red Nose Registry (OFRNR) considers human aggression a disqualification factor. The American Preservation Dog Registry (APDR) standard points out that \"the temperament must be totally reliable with people\".In September 2000, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a study that examined dog-bite\u2013related fatalities (human death caused by dog-bite injuries) to \"summarize breeds of dogs involved in fatal human attacks during a 20-year period and to assess policy implications.\" The study examined 238 fatalities between 1979 and 1998 in which the breed of dog was known. It found that \"the data indicates that Rottweilers and pit bull\u2013type dogs accounted for 67% of human DBRF [dog bite-related fatality] in the United States between 1979 and 1998\" and that it was \"extremely unlikely that they accounted for anywhere near 60% of dogs in the United States during that same period and, thus, there appears to be a breed-specific problem with fatalities.\"However, the article continued, noting that care should be taken in drawing conclusions based on these data because:,first, the study likely covered only about 74% of actual DBRF cases;,second, records of DBRF may have been biased by the propensity of media to report attacks by certain breeds over others;,third, it is not always straightforward to identify a dog's breed, and records may be biased towards reporting \"known\" aggressive breeds; and,fourth, it was not clear how to count mixed breeds." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5c4" }, "breed": "Ariegeois", "origin": "France", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariegeois", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Ariegeois.jpg/220px-Ariegeois.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5df6" }, "breed": "Ariegeois", "contenido": "The Ari\u00e9geois is a French breed of medium-sized scent hound from the d\u00e9partement of Ari\u00e8ge in the Midi-Pyren\u00e9es region of southern France.

The name originally given to the breed in 1928 was the \u00d6sterreichischer Kurzhaarpinscher (Austrian Shorthaired Pinscher) to differentiate it from similarly named breeds, but today in its country of origin the breed is officially called the \u00d6sterreichischer Pinscher, or Austrian Pinscher in English.,Like other farm dogs raised for work rather than for pets or show, the appearance can vary a great deal, although there is a definite breed standard. In general, the Austrian Pinscher is a normally proportioned strong and sturdy dog, 42\u201350 cm (17\u201320 in) at the withers. The breed has button ears and a head described as being shaped like a pear. The double coat is short to medium long, in a variety of yellow, red or black and tan colours, usually with white markings on the face, chest, feet and tip of the tail. The long tail is held high, and dogs of this breed should look lively and alert. They are heavier, more rugged and rectangular in appearance than the German Pinscher.,The Austrian Shorthaired Pinscher was recognised as a breed for the first time in 1928, but the breed was developed from an old type of pinscher found on farms in the  Austrian countryside, a mixture of German Pinschers and the local dogs.At the end of the 19th century, the farm dogs began to die out when the work they did was no longer needed. In the early 20th century Emil Hauck, looking for an aboriginal dog type identified in 1843 by H. von Meyer as Canis palustris or dog of the marshes (a type of dog, not an actual species), found what he believed were some examples of similar dogs in the Austrian countryside. In 1921 he began serious breeding to revive and define the type of the breed, to separate them from other landrace pinschers of the area. The Austrian Kennel Club (\u00d6sterreicher Kynologenverband) first recognised the breed as the \u00d6sterreichischer Kurzhaarpinscher (translates in English as Austrian Shorthaired Pinscher) in 1928. The name was given to the breed to identify its place of origin as Austria (\u00d6sterreich), and to differentiate it from the Schnauzer which at that time was called the Rough-haired Pinscher (rauhaariger Pinscher). After World War II, though, the breed almost vanished. In the 1970s only one registered dog of the breed remained, named Diokles of Angern. Breeding this dog with other dogs identified as of the old pinscher type in the area (\"Landpinschern\") has brought the breed back, although there are still only a small number of them.Ark Austria (Arche Austria), an association for the preservation of endangered indigenous breeds, lists the Austrian Pinscher and states that it is highly vulnerable, with only 6 to 12 breeding animals, who are being carefully bred to preserve health and breed type.The breed is recognised in its country of origin by the \u00d6sterreischer Kynologenverband (\u00d6KV, Austrian Kennel Club) and internationally by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in the Pinscher section of Group 2.

It is one of the oldest breeds of the British Isles. Cardigan Welsh Corgis are known to be an extremely loyal dog breed. They are also versatile and can live in a variety of settings.,Pembroke and Cardigan Welsh Corgis were originally listed as one breed by The Kennel Club in Britain in 1925, but were declared separate breeds in 1935. The Corgi Club was founded in December 1925 in Carmarthen in South Wales. It is reported that the local members favored the Pembroke breed, so a club for Cardigan enthusiasts was founded a year later (1926). Both groups have worked hard to ensure the appearance and type of breed are standardized through careful selective breeding. Pembrokes and Cardigans were officially recognized by the Kennel Club in 1928 and were lumped together under the heading Welsh Corgis. In 1934, the two breeds were recognized individually and shown separately.,One theory is that both breeds of the corgis descended from a line of northern spitz-type dogs. Another is that they descended from the Teckel family of dogs, which also produced Dachshunds.The word \"corgi\" is derived from the Welsh: cor gi, which means \"dwarf dog\". The breed was formerly called \"yard-long dog\" (Welsh: ci-llathed). Today's name comes from their area of origin: Cardigan (Welsh 'Ceredigion').,The Cardigan is a long, low dog with upright ears and a fox brush tail.Originally used only as a farm guardian, they eventually took on the traits of a cattle drover, herder, and many more. They are still highly valued for their herding, working, and guarding skills, as well as their companionship.  The old American Kennel Club standard called it an \"Alsatian on short legs\". The Cardigan's tail is long (unlike the Pembroke Welsh Corgi, whose tail may be long, naturally bobbed or docked).,Cardigans, which are double coated,  come in a variety of colors including any shade of red, sable, or brindle, as well as black, with or without tan, brindle or blue merle, with or without tan or brindle points. Other unofficial colors can occur, such as red merle, but these colors are not considered acceptable per the Cardigan standard. They usually have white on the neck, chest, legs, muzzle, underneath, tip of the tail and as a blaze on the head, known as the \"Irish pattern.\" Other markings include ticking on the legs and muzzle, smutty muzzles and monk's hoods, especially on sables (a pattern of darker tipped hairs over a basic red coat color.).  An average Cardigan is around 10 to 13 inches (250 to 330 mm) tall at the withers and weighs from 30 to 38 pounds (14 to 17 kg) for the male and 25 to 34 pounds (11 to 15 kg) for the female.Life expectancy is 12\u201316 years.

The coat features flecks of colour, and the different colour varieties are referred to as belton.,A gentle but at times strong-willed, mischievous gun dog, bred for a mix of endurance and athleticism, it is used to hunt for game such as quail, pheasant and grouse. When working, the dog will hunt methodically seeking the airborne scent of its prey. It is sometimes referred to as the Laverack or Llewellin Setter as these were famous strains of the breed during the major development period in the 19th century. Those from hunting stock are generally of a finer build and with less coat than those bred for show exhibition.,Generally reasonably healthy, they have an average life span of 11 to 12 years. The Kennel Club advises UK breeders to screen for hip dysplasia.,The English Setter is a medium-sized dog which should have an elegant overall appearance. Its size can range from 24 inches (61 cm) for females up to 27 inches (69 cm) for males. The field or hunting type can be finer in build and construction than those from bench or show lines. The breed was designed to hunt game such as quail, pheasant, and grouse so should be able to cover a lot of ground when seeking the airborne scent of the birds, carrying its head high. The head should be slightly domed with a muzzle of good depth and show chiselling under the eyes, which should be dark in colour with a kind, gentle expression. The top of the ears (sometimes the ears are referred to as \"leathers\") are positioned in line with the eyes and lie in an elegant fold. It has a long muscular neck, well angled shoulders and a brisket of good depth. The body is of a moderate length proportionate to its height and it has strong powerful hindquarters. It carries its tail in line with its back and the tail should be long enough to reach the hock.The main body coat is short to medium length, lies flat and has a silky texture. Long silky coat \u2013 usually called \"feathering\", forms fringes on the outside of the ears, neck, chest, down the back of the front legs, under the belly and on the back legs. The tail is also feathered with long coat.,The body coat and feathering should be straight and flat but not profuse and never curly although a slight wave can be seen.The bench or show type has a long, flowing coat that requires regular grooming. The field or hunting type has a shorter coat that requires less grooming.The base colour of the coat is white with differing coloured ticking also called flecks or speckling. The various speckled coat colours when occurring in English Setters are referred to as belton; valid combinations are white with black flecks (blue belton), white with orange flecks (orange belton), white with orange flecks and lighter nose (lemon belton), white with liver flecks (liver belton), or \"tricolour\", which is blue or liver belton with tan markings on the face, chest, and legs. The flecking should not form large patches on the body and the flecks should be distributed all over the body. The use of the word \"belton\" was first coined by Laverack, who developed the breed in the 19th century, to describe his ideal for flecking and is also the name of a village in the extreme north of England.

It is sometimes called the Irish Glen of Imaal Terrier or the Wicklow Terrier, and the name of the breed is often shortened by fanciers to just Glen.,The breed originates in, and is named for, the Glen of Imaal in County Wicklow, Ireland. It was recognised first by the Irish Kennel Club in 1934 and most recently by the American Kennel Club in 2004. The Canadian Kennel Club voted to fully recognize Glens in 2017 after the breed spent years on the Miscellaneous list; approval by Agriculture Canada is pending.,Reportedly, the Glen's history began during the reign of Elizabeth I, who hired French and Hessian mercenaries to put down a rebellion in Ireland. After the conflict, many of these soldiers settled in the Wicklow area. They brought with them their low-slung hounds, which they bred with the local terrier stock, eventually developing a distinctive breed that became known as the Glen of Imaal Terrier.Glens were originally used for eradicating other animals such as rat, fox, badger, and otter, and also as a general-purpose farm dog for herding and family companionship. Unlike many other terriers, they are \"strong dogs\" rather than \"sounders\"\u2014they were bred to work mute to ground, going silently into dens after their quarry rather than barking at it to alert their handlers. In hunting trials, which used to be required by many kennel clubs for championships, Glens were disqualified if they sounded at the quarry. For this reason, today they are among the quietest terriers.,According to Irish lore, Glen of Imaal Terriers were also used as turnspit dogs to turn meat over fires for cooking. Evidence for this is scarce, and engravings of such dogs from the 19th century do not bear much resemblance to today's Glen. It is, however, repeated in many descriptions of the breed and often used in color commentary by dog show announcers.The breed almost died out before being revived in the early twentieth century by breeders in its homeland. Paddy Brennan Tinahely Co Wicklow, and Willie Kane Tipperary are recognised as two breeders that revived the breed. Today, the Glen of Imaal Terrier is still one of the rarest breeds of dog (in the US, living registered animals number in the hundreds) and the least-known Irish terrier breed. It is considered a vulnerable native breed by the UK's Kennel Club, which tracks breeds in which fewer than 300 puppies are registered each year.[1],A \"big dog on short legs,\" the Glen of Imaal Terrier is an achondroplastic dwarf breed. It is more substantial than might be expected from photographs; a typical adult Glen weighs about 36 pounds and stands 14\" tall at the withers. The AKC breed standard specifies a height of 12\" to 14\" and a weight of \"approximately\" 35 pounds for males and \"somewhat less\" for females, with a length-to-height ratio of 5:3. Many champion Glens are larger than breed standard, with some individuals exceeding 40 or even 45 pounds. With three growth stages, a Glen can take up to four years to reach full maturity.,Glens have a large head, with rose or half-prick ears; short, bowed legs; and a straight topline that rises slightly toward the tail. The shoulders, chest, and hips are sturdy and muscular (the AKC breed standard specifies an impression of \"maximum substance for size\") and the front feet are turned out. The breed is considered unrefined, with antique features that were common in early terriers but which have since fallen out of favor with fanciers and breeders.,On their back, Glens have a unique double coat that is wiry with a soft undercoat. The head, sides, and legs have only the softer coat, which typically develops a degree of waviness. The color of the coat may be wheaten or blue (the latter usually with brindling), with both wheaten and blue encompassing a range of shades. Other colorings do occasionally occur in Glens (including a mixture of wheaten and blue referred to as \"grizzle\" and a \"blue and tan\" that is blue on top with wheaten furnishings) but these rare variations, while not disqualifications, are not favored by fanciers.  ,Wheaten Glen of Imaal puppies often have black highlights in their fur, and when young may show a \"dorsal stripe\" of darker fur down the middle of their backs, but this usually does not appear in their adult coat.,The Glen of Imaal terrier does not molt or shed much, and needs to be brushed or combed every week or two to keep the soft coat in good condition and free of matting. It is also typical to strip excess hair from the hard coat two to four times per year; this \"dead\" hair pulls out easily and painlessly with the proper tools.,Although some extra grooming is needed for showing (for example, the light-colored soft undercoat is often \"carded\" from the back to enhance the color of the darker wiry coat), the Glen is intended to have a \"rough and ready\" appearance, and show grooming requires less effort than in many other breeds. Glens should look tidy but natural, never manicured or clipped, in the conformation ring.,Historically, the breed's tail was typically docked to a length just sufficient to serve as a handhold for pulling the dog out of a badger hole. Docking is still standard in the United States, though some breeders have stopped doing it, and an intact tail is not a fault in AKC conformation showing. Many countries, however, ban docking for showing completely. Ireland has banned showing of dogs whose tails were docked on or after March 6, 2014 (the procedure is also itself illegal with very limited exceptions). In the UK, working terriers can still be shown with docked tails, but dogs kept as pets cannot." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5ff" }, "breed": "Labrador Retriever", "origin": "United KingdomNewfoundland Colony", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labrador_Retriever", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Labrador_on_Quantock_%282175262184%29.jpg/220px-Labrador_on_Quantock_%282175262184%29.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c740" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/labrador_retriever.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 5, "shedding": 4, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 5, "playfulness": 5, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 5, "energy": 5, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 12, "max_height_male": 24.5, "max_height_female": 24.5, "max_weight_male": 80, "max_weight_female": 70, "min_height_male": 22.5, "min_height_female": 22.5, "min_weight_male": 65, "min_weight_female": 55, "breed": "Labrador Retriever" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f0b" }, "breed": "Labrador Retriever", "contenido": "The Labrador Retriever or Labrador is a British breed of retriever gun dog. It was developed in the United Kingdom from fishing dogs imported from the colony of Newfoundland (now a province of Canada), and was named after the Labrador region of that colony. It is among the most commonly kept dogs in several countries, particularly in the Western world.,The Labrador is loyal, obedient and playful. It was bred as a sporting and hunting dog, but is widely kept as a companion dog. It may also be trained as a guide or assistance dog, or for rescue or therapy work.In the 1830s, the 10th Earl of Home and his nephews the 5th Duke of Buccleuch and Lord John Scott, imported progenitors of the breed from Newfoundland to Europe for use as gundogs. Another early advocate of these Newfoundland fishing dogs was the 2nd Earl of Malmesbury, who bred them for their expertise in waterfowling.During the 1880s, the 3rd Earl of Malmesbury, the 6th Duke of Buccleuch, and the 12th Earl of Home collaborated to develop and establish the Labrador Retriever breed. The dogs Buccleuch Avon and Buccleuch Ned, given by Malmesbury to Buccleuch, were mated with bitches carrying blood from those originally imported by the 5th Duke and the 10th Earl of Home. The offspring are the ancestors of all modern Labradors.,The Labrador breed dates back to at least the 1830s, when St. John's water dogs bred by European settlers in Newfoundland, were first introduced to Britain from ships trading between Canada and Poole in Dorsetshire. These were then bred with British hunting dogs to create what became known as the Labrador Retriever. Its early patrons included the Earl of Malmesbury, the Duke of Buccleuch, the Earl of Home, and Sir John Scott. Early writers have confused the Labrador with the much larger Newfoundland and the Lesser Newfoundland, with Charles St. John even referring to the Lesser Newfoundland as the Newfoundland. Colonel Peter Hawker describes the first Labrador as being not larger than an English Pointer, more often black than other colours, long in its head and nose with a deep chest, fine legs, and short and smooth coat, and did not carry its tail as highly as the Newfoundland. Hawker distinguishes the Newfoundland from both the \"proper Labrador\" and St. John's breed of these dogs in the fifth edition of his book Introductions to Young Sportsman, published in 1846.The first photograph of the breed was taken in 1857 (the Earl of Home's dog \"Nell\", described both as a Labrador and a St. John's water dog). By 1870, the name Labrador Retriever became common in England. The first yellow Labrador on record was born in 1899 (Ben of Hyde, kennels of Major C.J. Radclyffe), and the breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1903. The first American Kennel Club (AKC) registration was in 1917. The Liver (now typically called Chocolate) Labrador emerged in the late 1800s, with liver-coloured pups documented at the Buccleuch kennels in 1892. The first dog to appear on the cover of Life magazine was a black Labrador Retriever called \"Blind of Arden\" in the 12 December 1938 issue.,There is a great deal of variety among Labradors. The following characteristics are typical of the conformation show bred (bench-bred) lines of this breed in the United States and are based on the American Kennel Club standard. Significant differences between U.K. and U.S. standards are noted." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c602" }, "breed": "Leonberger", "origin": "Germany", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonberger", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Leonberger_male.jpg/220px-Leonberger_male.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c743" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/leonberger.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 4, "grooming": 4, "drooling": 3, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 5, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 4, "trainability": 5, "energy": 3, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 7, "max_life_expectancy": 7, "max_height_male": 31.5, "max_height_female": 31.5, "max_weight_male": 170, "max_weight_female": 140, "min_height_male": 28, "min_height_female": 28, "min_weight_male": 110, "min_weight_female": 90, "breed": "Leonberger" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f13" }, "breed": "Leonberger", "contenido": "The Leonberger is a dog breed, whose name derives from the city of Leonberg in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany.,This breed occurs with a generous double coat; the Leonberger is a large, muscular, and elegant dog with balanced body type, medium temperament, and dramatic presence.

They can be black, brown, grey, or white. However, in the Dominion of Newfoundland, before it became part of the confederation of Canada, only black and Landseer (white-and-black) coloured dogs were considered to be proper members of the breed. They were originally bred and used as working dogs for fishermen in Newfoundland. Newfoundlands are known for their giant size, intelligence, tremendous strength, calm disposition, love of children and loyalty. They excel at water rescue/lifesaving because of their muscular build, thick double coat, webbed paws, and swimming abilities.,Newfoundlands ('Newfs' or 'Newfies') have webbed paws and a water-resistant coat. Males normally weigh 65\u201380 kg (143\u2013176 lb), and females 55\u201365 kg (121\u2013143 lb), placing them in the \"Giant\" weight range; but some Newfoundlands have been known to weigh over 90 kg (200 lb) \u2013 and the largest on record weighed 120 kg (260 lb) and measured over 1.8 m (6 ft) from nose to tail, ranking it among the largest of dog breeds. They may grow up to 56\u201376 cm (22\u201330 in) tall at the shoulder.The American Kennel Club (AKC) standard colours of the Newfoundland are black, brown, grey, and white-and-black (sometimes referred to as a Landseer). Other colours are possible but are not considered rare or more valuable. The Kennel Club (KC) permits only black, brown, and white/black; the Canadian Kennel Club (CKC) permits only black and white/black. The \"Landseer\" pattern is named after the artist, Sir Edwin Henry Landseer, who featured them in many of his paintings. F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) consider the ECT Landseer (\"European Continental Type\") to be a separate breed. It is a taller, more narrow white dog with black markings not bred with a Newfoundland.The Newfoundland's extremely large bones give it mass, while its large musculature gives it the power it needs to take on rough ocean waves and powerful tides. These dogs have huge lung capacity for swimming extremely long distances and a thick, oily, and waterproof double coat which protects them from the chill of icy waters. The double coat makes the dog hard to groom, and also causes a lot of shedding to occur. The droopy lips and jowls make the dog drool, especially in high heat.,In the water, the Newfoundland's massive webbed paws give it maximum propulsion. The swimming stroke is not an ordinary dog paddle: Unlike other dogs, the Newfoundland moves its limbs in a down-and-out motion giving more power to every stroke.,The Newfoundland is known for its calm and docile nature and its strength. They are very loyal, have a mild nature, and make great working dogs. It is for this reason that this breed is known as \"the gentle giant\". International kennel clubs generally describe the breed as having a sweet temper. The breed typically has a deep bark and is easy to train if started young. They are wonderfully good with children, but small children can get accidentally leaned on and knocked down. Newfoundlands are ideal companions in the world of therapy and are often referred to as \"nanny dogs\". The breed was memorialised in \"Nana\", the beloved guardian dog in J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan. The Newfoundland, in general, is good with other animals, but its size can cause problems if it is not properly trained." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c608" }, "breed": "Norwegian Buhund", "origin": "Norway", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Buhund", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Norwegian_Buhund_600.jpg/220px-Norwegian_Buhund_600.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c745" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/norwegian_buhund.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 4, "trainability": 3, "energy": 4, "barking": 4, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 15, "max_height_male": 18.5, "max_height_female": 18.5, "max_weight_male": 40, "max_weight_female": 35, "min_height_male": 17, "min_height_female": 17, "min_weight_male": 31, "min_weight_female": 26, "breed": "Norwegian Buhund" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f3a" }, "breed": "Norwegian Buhund", "contenido": "The Norwegian Buhund (Norwegian: Norsk buhund) is a breed of dog of the spitz type.

The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.,It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion dog, and according to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations in 2013.,During the 1890s, attempts were being made to standardise dog breeds. Dogs were being bred to preserve traits that assisted in their job of herding sheep and protecting their flocks from predators. In Germany this was practised within local communities, where shepherds selected and bred dogs. It was recognised that the breed had the necessary skills for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen senses of smell. The results were dogs that were able to do such things, but that differed significantly, both in appearance and ability, from one locality to another.To combat these differences, the Phylax Society was formed in 1891 with the intention of creating standardised development plans for native dog breeds in Germany. The society disbanded after only three years due to ongoing internal conflicts regarding the traits in dogs that the society should promote; some members believed dogs should be bred solely for working purposes, while others believed dogs should be bred also for appearance. While unsuccessful in their goal, the Phylax Society had inspired people to pursue standardising dog breeds independently.,With the rise of large, industrialised cities in Germany, the predator population began to decline, rendering sheepdogs unnecessary. At the same time, the awareness of sheepdogs as a versatile, intelligent class of canine began to rise. Max von Stephanitz, an ex-cavalry captain and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was an ex-member of the Phylax Society who firmly believed dogs should be bred for working. He admired the intelligence, strength and ability of Germany's native sheepdogs, but could not find any one single breed that satisfied him as the perfect working dog.In 1899, von Stephanitz was attending a dog show when he was shown a dog named Hektor Linksrhein. Hektor was the product of few generations of selective breeding and completely fulfilled what von Stephanitz believed a working dog should be. He was pleased with the strength of the dog and was so taken by the animal's intelligence, loyalty, and beauty, that he purchased him immediately. After purchasing the dog he changed his name to Horand von Grafrath and von Stephanitz founded the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde (Society for German Shepherd Dogs). Horand was declared to be the first German Shepherd Dog, and was the first dog added to the society's breed register. In just a few decades of the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde's establishment, the breed became one of the world's most popular and numerous, a position it has maintained to this day. By 1923, the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde claimed 50,000 dues-paying members in more than 500 branches in Germany alone.Horand became the center-point of the breeding programs and was bred with dogs belonging to other society members that displayed desirable traits and with dogs from Thuringia, Franconia, and W\u00fcrttemberg. Fathering many pups, Horand's most prolific was Hektor von Schwaben. Hektor was inbred with another of Horand's offspring and produced Heinz von Starkenburg, Beowulf, and Pilot, who later sired a total of 84 pups, mostly through being inbred with Hektor's other offspring. This inbreeding was deemed necessary in order to fix the traits being sought in the breed. Beowulf's progeny also were inbred and it is from these pups that all German shepherds draw a genetic link. It is believed the society accomplished its goal mostly due to von Stephanitz's strong, uncompromising leadership and he is therefore credited with being the creator of the German Shepherd Dog.During the first half of the twentieth century, the breed came to be strongly identified with Imperial and Nazi Germany, because of its association with purity and militarism. German shepherds were coveted as \"germanische Urhunde\", being close to the wolf, and became very fashionable during the Nazi era. Adolf Hitler acquired a German Shepherd named \"Prinz\" in 1921, during his years of poverty, but he had been forced to lodge the dog elsewhere. However, she managed to escape and return to him. Hitler, who adored the loyalty and obedience of the dog, thereafter developed a great liking for the breed. Hitler kept several more of the breed, including Blondi, who was among several dogs in the 'F\u00fchrerbunker' during the Battle of Berlin at the end of the Second World War. Dogs played a role in Nazi propaganda by portraying Hitler as an animal lover. Preparing for his suicide, Hitler ordered Dr. Werner Haase to test a cyanide capsule on Blondi, and the dog died as a result. Erna Flegel, a nurse who worked at the emergency casualty station in the Reich Chancellery stated in 2005 that Blondi's death had affected the people in the bunker more than Eva Braun's suicide. German Shepherds were also used widely as guard dogs at Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust.When the German Shepherd was introduced to the United States it was initially a popular dog. But as the dogs' popularity grew, it became associated as a dangerous breed owned by gangsters and bootleggers. The reputation of the German shepherds as a dangerous breed had grown to such an extent that it was briefly banned to import them in Australia in 1929. Potential legislation was even considered to require that all German shepherds in South Australia be sterilised.,The breed was named Deutscher Sch\u00e4ferhund, by von Stephanitz, literally translating to \"German Shepherd Dog\".  At the time, all other herding dogs in Germany were referred to by this name; they thus became known as Altdeutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde, or Old German herding dogs.,The direct translation of the name was adopted for use in the stud-book; however, at the end of the First World War, it was believed that the inclusion of the word \"German\" would harm the breed's popularity, due to the anti-German sentiment of the era. The breed was officially renamed by the UK Kennel Club to \"Alsatian Wolf Dog\", after the French region of Alsace bordering Germany.Eventually, the appendage \"wolf dog\" was dropped, after numerous campaigns by breeders who were worried that becoming known as a wolf-dog hybrid would affect the breed's popularity and legality. The name Alsatian remained for five decades, until 1977, when successful campaigns by dog enthusiasts pressured the British kennel clubs to allow the breed to be registered again as German Shepherds. The word \"Alsatian\" once appeared in parentheses as part of the formal breed name of the American Kennel Club and was removed in 2010." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c61a" }, "breed": "Tibetan Terrier", "origin": "Tibet", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Terrier", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Tibet_Terrier_Bennie_%28cropped%29.jpg/220px-Tibet_Terrier_Bennie_%28cropped%29.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c749" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/tibetan_terrier.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 3, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 4, "trainability": 3, "energy": 4, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 15, "max_life_expectancy": 16, "max_height_male": 17, "max_height_female": 17, "max_weight_male": 31, "max_weight_female": 31, "min_height_male": 14, "min_height_female": 14, "min_weight_male": 18, "min_weight_female": 18, "breed": "Tibetan Terrier" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fe1" }, "breed": "Tibetan Terrier", "contenido": "The Tibetan Terrier is a medium-sized breed of dog that originated in Tibet. Despite its name, it is not a member of the terrier group. The breed was given its English name by European travelers due to its resemblance to known terrier breeds. The Tibetan name for the breed, Tsang Apso, roughly translates to \"shaggy or bearded (\"apso\") dog, from the province of Tsang\". Some old travelers' accounts refer to the dog as Dokhi Apso or \"outdoor\" Apso, indicating a shaggy or bearded working dog which lives outdoors.,Historically, Tibetan Terriers were kept as good luck charms, mascots, watchdogs, herding dogs, and companions. They were also used to retrieve articles that fell down mountainsides.Dr. Agnes Greig of England brought the first Tibetan Terrier to Europe in 1922. She was given a gold and white female puppy named \"Bunti\" after successfully performing an operation on a patient in Tibet. After acquiring a second male, \"Rajah,\" Dr. Greig established a kennel and began to breed them.,The first litter was born in 1924 and were registered as Lhasa Terriers. In 1930, the Kennel Club of India changed the breed's name to Tibetan Terrier. The first Tibetan Terriers in the US were imported in 1956 by Dr. Henry and Mrs. Alice Murphy of Great Falls, Virginia, from Dr. Greig's kennel, Lamleh. In 1973, the American Kennel Club recognized the breed, classifying it as part of the non-sporting group.Tibetan Terriers are related to and have contributed to the development of other breeds, including the Shih Tzu, Lhasa Apso, Tibetan Spaniel, Polish Lowland Sheepdog, among others.,The Tibetan Terrier is a powerful, medium-sized dog of square proportions, with a shaggy coat. They vary widely in height and weight, ranging from 14\u201316 in (35\u201341 cm) and is 18\u201330 lb (8\u201314 kg), with 20\u201324 lb (9.5\u201311 kg) preferred for either sex. All weights are acceptable if in proportion to the size. Fully grown, the Tibetan Terrier resembles a miniaturized Bearded Collie. The head is moderate, with a strong muzzle of medium length, and a skull neither rounded nor flat. The eyes are large, dark, and set fairly far apart. The V-shaped drop ears are well-feathered, and should be set high on the sides of the skull. Although the preferred colour for the nose is black, in showdogs, they are also sometimes brown. The body is well-muscled and compact. The length of the back should be equal to the height at the withers, giving the breed its typical square look. The tail is set high, well-feathered, and carried in a curl over the back. One of the more unusual features of the Tibetan Terrier is their broad, flat feet with hair between the toes, which are ideal for climbing mountains, acting as natural snowshoes.,The hair of the Tibetan Terrier has a long growth cycle. As a result, their coat grows quite long and pet animals will require occasional trimming. They do not shed like dogs with shorter hair growth cycles, but rather slough hair at a rate similar to that of most humans. The exception is at approximately nine months when puppies slough their entire coat in advance of acquiring their adult coat. The double coat is profuse, with a warm undercoat and a topcoat which has the texture of human hair. It should not be silky or curled, but wavy is acceptable. Long and thick, it is shown natural, but should not be so long as to touch the floor, as is typical in breeds such as the Lhasa Apso or Maltese.

Russian publications indicate that the term West Siberian Laika loosely applied to hunting dogs originating with the Mansi and Khanty people in Ural and West Siberia, but there were no standards or registrations of WSL as such until 1930. Then WWII disrupted it for a while, but systematic breeding with registrations resumed after the war ended, in 1946. This was the time the breed began taking modern shape.  Before that hunters only knew of Mansi Laika and Khanty Laika. In early 1960 many hunters in Ural still preferred the term Mansi Laika, when speaking of West Siberian Laika. In Russian language, the term Laika originated from the word layat that means to bark. The word Laika simply means barker. Any hunting Laika is a bark pointer (pointing at animal of interest by barking and staying with the animal ). It is a versatile dog depending on use and environment, but in certain parts of the country they have become more specialized.,Laikas resemble those dogs that originally accompanied humans since prehistory worldwide, until they became replaced with lop-eared, specialized for certain style of hunting, cultured breeds. In large sparser populated parts of Russia, this process came at a later time and aboriginal Laika types still remain with hunters in remote northern and northeastern provinces of the country.Deforestation of land for agriculture and industrialization in later 19th-early 20th Centuries accelerated replacement of Laikas with other popular at the time dogs. Russian experts of the late 19th century distinguished dozens of varieties of aboriginal Laikas, each associated with a particular ethnic group of indigenous people of northeastern Europe and Siberia, but none of them had been considered as purebred and pedigreed.  Russians tried to save some hunting Laikas from extinction by bringing them from different provincial parts of Russia in cities of European part of the country and breeding them pure. Starting from thirtieth and especially after WW II, they established four breeds as purebreds: the Karelo-Finnish Laika, the Russ-European Laika, the West Siberian Laika and the East Siberian Laika. They all are bark-pointing dogs and their hunting behavior is generally similar. All of them are descendants of aboriginal types of Laikas selectively sampled from large territories and lumped into the four breeds for breeding in kennels.  Among all of them, the West Siberian Laika became most popular and by present time it is most numerous Laika far beyond its original range in Russia.,Laikas belong to northern primitive breeds retaining traits of their wild ancestor, the wolf, in the appearance and behavior. They are dogs with pointed muzzle, slightly rangy or nearly square body and often gray or gray mixed with red like in the wolf coat color predominate. They are small to medium size pariah- type dogs.The West Siberian Laika is a medium to large size dog. Males are 22\u201324 in (56\u201361 cm) and females are 20\u201323 in (51\u201358 cm) at the shoulder.,The coat of the West Siberian Laika is a double coat of harsh straight guard hairs and thick and soft undercoat. The guard hairs on the neck, around the head and shoulders are particularly long and stiff. Together with a very thick undercoat they form a ruff framing the dog's face. On the tail, the guard hair and undercoat are also longer and thicker than on the rest of the body. In wintertime, dogs living in cold climate grow hair between the toes. Although the coat quality varies individually, dogs raised in countries with cold climates have longer and thicker coats than dogs that live in warm and hot climates or dogs that are kept inside most of the time.,Most common coat colors are wolf gray, pale red and white. The gray coat can be of various shades from almost white to very dark gray, nearly black. The gray can be mixed with red producing array of brownish and red shades. Dogs with either coat color described above may have white patches in different proportions. Pale red and white dogs may have brown noses and lips. Dogs with either coat color have so-called \"zonary\" pattern of distribution of pigment in each guard hair. This means guard hair has alternating bands (zones) of white with black, brown or red color. Hairs with evenly distributed pigment indicate an admixture of other than Laika breed.,The head is wedge-shaped in the form of a triangle, flat on the top and broader between ears. In the Mansi Laika, the head is more elongate with muzzle as long as the skull from eye to occiput or slightly longer. In the Khanty Laika, the head is broader and the muzzle is as long as the skull or slightly shorter. Lips are always close and lean. A full set of large teeth with a scissors bite is typical, but dogs with vice bite also occur. The standard accepts scissors bite only. In many dogs with a scissors bite at young age the bite is changing with age and becomes a vice bite by age of 5\u20136 years.,Eyes are almond-shaped, medium size, deep set and distinctly slanted. Their colors are brown to dark brown. Dogs with amber yellow and/or blue eyes rarely occur, but hunters believe that dogs with brown and dark brown eyes are better hunting dogs. According to the standard, any eye color, except brown and light brown is a fault.,Ears are always pricked and directed straight up, but their size, pointed or slightly rounded tips of ears are variable. Generally, ears of the Khanty Laika are small to medium. In the Mansi Laika, ears are medium to long. Ears can be set high and close to each other or slightly apart.,The tail is carried high curving over the back. Details of its structure and carriage are variable among aboriginal dogs. In majority of dogs, the tip of the tail lies on the back, but some dogs have the tip of the tail rigidly curved like a fishhook. Among aboriginal dogs, there are individuals with a sickle-shaped tail, but it is considered faulty by the modern breed standard." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c61e" }, "breed": "English Water Spaniel", "origin": "United Kingdom", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Water_Spaniel", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/English_Water_Spaniel.jpg/220px-English_Water_Spaniel.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e9c" }, "breed": "English Water Spaniel", "contenido": "The English Water Spaniel is a breed of dog that has been extinct since the first part of the 20th century, with the last specimen seen in the 1930s. It was best known for its use in hunting waterfowl and for being able to dive as well as a duck. It is described as  similar to a Collie or to a cross between a Poodle and a Springer Spaniel with curly fur and typically in a white and liver/tan pattern.,Pre-dating the Irish Water Spaniel and thought to have been referred to by Shakespeare in Macbeth, it is believed to have genetically influenced several modern breeds of dog, including the American Water Spaniel, Curly Coated Retriever and the modern variety of Field Spaniel. It is unknown if the breed was involved in the creation of the Irish Water Spaniel.,In 1570, Dr John Caius described the Water Spaniel. It has been suggested that Shakespeare  also knew the breed \"for he mentions the `water rug' in Macbeth. \" Furthermore, Shakespeare specifically mentions the breed in Act III Scene 1 of The Two Gentlemen of Verona when Launce says of his love, \"She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel.\",The breed is mentioned specifically by name as early as 1802, in Sportsman's Cabinet, where it is described as having \"hair long and naturally curled, not loose and shaggy\"; the description accompanied an engraving of a liver and white curly coated spaniel. This shows that they pre-date the Irish Water Spaniel which was not developed as a breed until the 1830s. Unfortunately as the person credited with developing the Irish Water Spaniel, Justin McCarthy, left no written records, it is unknown if the English Water Spaniel was involved in its development. During the first half of the 18th century, the English Water Spaniel was used for duck hunting in East Anglia.The Kennel Club initially had a class for \"Water spaniels other than Irish\" as no standard was specifically set up for the English Water Spaniel and the judging of this class was described as \"chaos\" by Hugh Dalziel in British Dogs: Their Varieties, History, Characteristics, Breeding, Management, And Exhibition. Writing in 1897, Dalziel said of the breed, \"I do not believe the breed is lost, but that scattered throughout the country there are many specimens of the old English water spaniel, which it only requires that amount of encouragement to breeding which it is in the power of show committees to give to perpetuate the variety and improve its form.\" Dalziel bemoaned the fact that while the Irish Water Spaniel continued, the English Water Spaniel was allowed to quietly be absorbed into other Spaniel breeds.,The stud book of the Kennel Club also had a class for \"Water spaniels other than Irish\", however only fourteen dogs were registered in the twelve years up to 1903. This led some writers and judges of that time to believe that the English Water Spaniel was merely a cross of the Irish Water Spaniel as entrants in dogs shows in that same class do not match the description of the dog from earlier periods. Dogs awarded prizes as Water Spaniels during this period have been described as having \"coats as flat as a Clumber, but with a bit of longish hair about the top of the skull.\"Writing in 1967, author John F. Gordon stated, \"After two centuries of breeding it is now extinct. None have been seen for over thirty years.\" Descendant breeds of the English Water Spaniel are thought to include the American Water Spaniel, which was also developed using additional stock from the Irish Water Spaniel and the Flat Coated Retriever breeds. The Curly Coated Retriever is considered to have descended from the Poodle, the retrieving setter, the St. John's water dog and the English Water Spaniel. Records for the origin of the modern Field Spaniel are more precise and show that one of the four progenitor dogs used in creating the breed was an English Water Spaniel-Cocker Spaniel cross which was registered at the time as a Sussex Spaniel due to his liver colour." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c626" }, "breed": "Buryat-Mongolian Wolfhound", "origin": "Russia, Mongolia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buryat-Mongolian_Wolfhound", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Hotosho-1.jpg/220px-Hotosho-1.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e45" }, "breed": "Buryat-Mongolian Wolfhound", "contenido": "The Buryat-Mongolian Wolfhound (Buryat: Hotosho, Mongolian: Bankhar, Russian: \u0411\u0443\u0440\u044f\u0442-\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0432), is a landrace livestock guarding dog. Originally bred by the Buryat people, their success contributed to their spread across Buryatia and Mongolia and into adjacent regions before they were nearly annihilated in the mid-20th Century.  Buryat-Mongolian Wolfhounds are prized for their intellect and perseverance even in hostile weather conditions. They are loyal and affectionate with their families, but formidable against intruders, including humans, wolves, eagles and snow leopards. ,While undoubtedly an ancient breed, genetic analysis indicates that the Buryat-Mongolian Wolfhound is a basal breed and may be the progenitor of all livestock guarding dogs.  Buryat legend states that the breed appeared as a huge ferocious dog that accompanied a giant descending from the mountains. The descendants of this dog are the Buryat-Mongolian Wolfhound.  Buryat-Mongolian Wolfhounds are alleged to have participate in the raids of Genghis Khan, instilling fear in people and helping to capture villages and cities.The only native breed of Mongolia, Buryat-Mongolian Wolfhounds maintained their genetic purity through geographic isolation. As infrastructure and travel made the Buryat-Mongolian Wolfhound's native regions more accessible, non-native dogs began to intermix. During the Communist era of Mongolia, Buryat-Mongolian Wolfhounds were let loose or exterminated to forcibly relocate nomadic groups into socialist-style settlements.  Buryat-Mongolian Wolfhound pelts became fashionable for stylish Russian coats, and the largest dogs were killed to feed the growing dog coat industry. By the 1980s, the breed had almost disappeared. ,There has since been renewed interest to preserve the breed in Russia and Mongolia; however the breed is still endangered.  The decline of effective livestock guarding dogs has caused nomadic herders to resort to shooting or poisoning any threats toward their herds. As a result, there has been a significant decrease in the populations of gray wolves and snow leopards in these regions. ,Buryat-Mongolian Wolfhounds are a large, formidable breed with either a short or long coat in red, black, and black and tan. Darker dogs with light spots above the eyes are preferred, these are known as Mongolian Four Eye Dogs. The distinct markings help to distinguish dogs from wolves in low light conditions and Mongolian legend states that these dogs can see into the spirit world.  Despite their size, they should be athletic, fast, cheerful, energetic, courageous and tireless dogs. In Buryat, they are called \"hotosho\", which means \"yard wolf,\" and in Mongolian they are called \"bankhar\" meaning \"chubby, fat, fluffy.\"  Despite this second name, Buryat-Mongolian Wolfdogs are not a fat breed, just big a 50-60 kilograms (110-132 lbs) with a height of up to 75 centimeters (29.5 inches.) Buryat-Mongolian Wolfhounds have low calorie needs for their size.  Despite their appearances, Buryat-Mongolian Wolfhounds are only distantly related to the larger Tibetan Mastiff." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c628" }, "breed": "Continental bulldog", "origin": "Switzerland", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_bulldog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Pitsch-Dog.jpg/220px-Pitsch-Dog.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e6f" }, "breed": "Continental bulldog", "contenido": "The Continental Bulldog, or Conti for short, is a newer dog breed created in Switzerland. It is officially recognized by the FCI since 2022.,Imelda Angehrn of Switzerland, now nicknamed the \"Grand Old Lady of the Bulldogs\", grew up in a veterinarian and farmer household and started breeding Bulldogs in 1966. She was distressed that the Bulldog had so many health problems, including difficulties with breathing and whelping such big-headed broad-shouldered puppies through narrow female hips. Wanting bulldogs that were more mobile, able to breathe freely and give birth naturally, she started breeding lighter dogs, but they could not win at shows. After researching her options, she decided to start a new breed, including outcrossing with the Olde English Bulldogge. In 2001, her first EB x OEB crosses were born.The Swiss Kennel Club permitted the creation of the new breed in September 2004 under the name the \"Continental Bulldog\". The Continental Bulldog Club of Switzerland was founded in 2004, and the breed, its standard, and the club were announced by the Swiss Kennel Club in 2005. At the club's founding meeting, it was announced that all of the dogs were to be entered into the Swiss Studbook and would be eligible to participate in international and national shows in Switzerland.In order to be recognized by the international organization the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI), it required eight bloodlines, in which the last three generations may not have a single common ancestor.

Unlike other laikas, Nenets Herding Laika are less commonly used for hunting.  Instead they have been selected primarily for reindeer herding ability, originally by the Nenets people, and later by reindeer herders through Russia.  Nenets herding laika are thought to be the progenitor of several modern breeds, the most well-documented being the Samoyed. Despite this, the breed almost died out during the Soviet era due to lack of interest in preserving genetically purebred examples. In 1994, the Russian Kynologic Federation (RKF) approved the first official standard of the breed.,Nenets Herding Laika are small to medium-sized dogs with a thick double coats that are either solid or bicolored, coming in grey, tan, red, black or white. They come in two coat lengths, a long-haired coat called \u201cerre\u201d and a short-haired coat called \u201cyando,\u201d and they should retain a well developed coat through the summer. Regardless of coat length, the guard hairs should be straight, stiff and long, with a luxurious, soft undercoat.  Differences between the sexes should be apparent. ,Nenets Herding Laika should impart harmonious functionality and undemanding resilience. They should have well developed muscles, a moderate wedge-shaped head with small, prick ears and a tail that curves over the back or is kept down depending on mood. Nenets Herding Laika are confident, energetic dogs who are learn quickly and strive to please their humans.,The Nenets Laika is one of the oldest dog breeds, surviving from the Paleolithic era to the present day almost unchanged.  Prized for their efficiency as a reindeer herding dog, by the 1930s Nenets Herding Laika had spread across the Arctic circle, stretching from the Kola Peninsula to Chukotka. Though the Nenets people themselves traditionally used reindeer to haul their sleds, several arctic explorers would use Nenets Herding Laika as sled dogs, most notably Russian painter and explorer Alexandr Borisov and Norwegian explorer and scientist Fridtjof Nansen. The all-white surviving dogs from Nansen\u2019s Fram expedition would form the foundation stock of the Samoyed.As infrastructure and mechanized travel made Arctic regions more accessible, non-native dogs began to intermix with the Nenets Herding Laika population. This, combined with a prevalent belief that only registered purebred dogs had any value, contributed to Nenets Herding Laika\u2019s decline. Near the end of the Soviet era, it was widely believed there were no pure Nenets Herding Laika remaining. Fortunately, several small populations were discovered after the fall of the Iron Curtain and efforts are underway to preserve the breed in Russia. However the breed continues to be virtually unknown outside of Russia and Norway. There are currently estimated to be around 2000 purebred Nenets Herding Laika herding reindeer in Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug.,In recent years, Nenets Herding Laika have shown proficiency in search and rescue. The Sulimov jackal-dog hybrids used for bomb detection in Moscow International Airport are part Nenets Herding Dog.

The Irish Terrier is considered one of the oldest terrier breeds. The Dublin dog show in 1873 was the first to provide a separate class for Irish Terriers. By the 1880s, Irish Terriers were the fourth most popular breed in Ireland and Britain.The Irish Terrier is an active and compactly sized dog that is suited for life in both rural and city environments. Its harsh red coat protects it from all kinds of weather.,Breed standards describe the ideal Irish Terrier as being racy, red and rectangular. Racy: an Irish Terrier should appear powerful without being sturdy or heavy. Rectangular: the outline of the Irish Terrier differs markedly from those of other terriers. The Irish Terrier's body is proportionately longer than that of the Fox Terrier, with a tendency toward racy lines but with no lack of substance. The deep chest is distinctive.,Formerly, the tail was customarily docked soon after birth to approximately two-thirds of the original length. In countries where docking is prohibited, the conformation judges emphasise tail carriage. The tail should start up quite high, but it should not stick straight up or curl over the back or either side of its body. The ears are small and folded forward just above skull level. They are preferably slightly darker than the rest of the coat.,The Irish Terrier is coloured golden red, red wheaten, or wheaten. Dark red is often mistaken as the only correct colour, possibly because wheaten coats are often of worse quality. As with many other solid-coloured breeds, a small patch of white is allowed on the chest. No white should appear elsewhere. As an Irish Terrier grows older, grey hair may appear here and there.,The outer part of the double coat should be straight and wiry in texture, never soft, silky, curly, wavy, or woolly as might be expected in the Kerry Blue Terrier. The coat should lie flat against the skin, and, though having some length, should never be so long as to hide the true shape of the dog. There are longer hairs on the legs, but never so much as a Wire Fox Terrier or Schnauzer. That means you have to have the coat trimmed often which can be expensive." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4ae" }, "breed": "Istrian Shorthaired Hound", "origin": "Croatia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istrian_Shorthaired_Hound", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Istrische_Bracke.jpg/220px-Istrische_Bracke.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ee9" }, "breed": "Istrian Shorthaired Hound", "contenido": "The Istrian Short-haired Hound (original name is Istarski Kratkodlaki Goni\u010d) is a breed of dog from Istria in Croatia, descended from a very old type of scenthound.

The breed has a typical well-muscled hound body, with long legs and a long tail.

A description was given by the Bishop of \u0110akovo Petar Baki\u0107 in 1719. The old type is seen in the Posavaz Hound and the Istrian Coarse-haired Hound, as well. The smooth- and coarse-haired hounds were used for hunting in Istria (see the article on Motovun for photographs of the sort of mountainous terrain they were bred to hunt) while the Posavaz Hound is from the Sava Valley.

The FCI accepted the breed in 1949, but  the first breed standard was not published until 1973 (the FCI does not write the breed standard, it is written in the breed's country of origin and published by the FCI to be used internationally, so that other countries will also describe the breed in the same manner as the breed's home country, and not change it to suit themselves.) It is recognised in the scenthound group 6. It is also recognised in the scenthound group in North America by the United Kennel Club. It also is recognised under its original name, the standard English translations, other translations or combinations of the translation and Croatian name by minor kennel clubs and other organisations. It also may be promoted as a rare breed for those seeking an unusual pet.,The Istrian Short-haired Hound is still kept in its homeland and in nearby areas for hunting, not as a pet, and is especially valued for hunting fox and rabbit.,No specific health problems or claims of extraordinary health have been documented for this breed. The ideal temperament according to the standard is docile and calm, and lively and enthusiastic when hunting." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4b3" }, "breed": "Japanese Spitz", "origin": "Japan", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Spitz", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/JapaneseSpitzPhoto1_-_hiro.jpg/220px-JapaneseSpitzPhoto1_-_hiro.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6ad" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/japanese_spitz.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 3, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 3, "energy": 3, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 14, "max_height_male": 15, "max_height_female": 15, "max_weight_male": 25, "max_weight_female": 25, "min_height_male": 12, "min_height_female": 12, "min_weight_male": 10, "min_weight_female": 10, "breed": "Japanese Spitz" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5eee" }, "breed": "Japanese Spitz", "contenido": "The Japanese Spitz (\u65e5\u672c\u30b9\u30d4\u30c3\u30c4, Nihon Supittsu) is a small to medium breed of dog of the Spitz type. There are varying standards around the world as to the ideal size of the breed, but they are always larger than their smaller cousins, the Pomeranian. They were developed in Japan in the 1920s and 1930s by breeding a number of other Spitz type dog breeds together. They are recognized by the vast majority of the major kennel clubs, except the American Kennel Club due to it being of similar appearance to the white Pomeranian, American Eskimo Dog and Samoyed. While they are a relatively new breed, they are becoming widely popular due to their favorable temperament and other features.,The major health concern is patellar luxation, and a minor recurring concern is that the breed can be prone to runny eyes. They can act as reliable watchdogs, but are a type of companion dog and prefer to be an active part of the family. Although they might appear fluffy, they are a low maintenance breed as dirt does not stick to the coat.,The Japanese Spitz is a small dog, around 33 cm (13 ins) at the withers, with a somewhat square body, deep chest, and a very thick, pure white double coat. The coat consists of an outer coat that stands off from the soft inner coat, with fur shorter on the muzzle and ears as well as the fronts of the forelegs and the hindlegs.  A ruff of longer fur is around the dog's neck. It has a pointed muzzle and small, triangular shape prick ears (ears that stand up.) The tail is long, heavily covered with long fur, and is carried curled over and lying on the dog's back. The white coat contrasts with the black pads and nails of the feet, the black nose, and the dark eyes. The large oval (akin to a ginkgo seed) eyes are dark and slightly slanted with white eyelashes, and the nose and lips and eye rims are black. The face of the Japanese Spitz is wedge-shaped.They share a common resemblance with the white Pomeranian, Samoyed and American Eskimo Dog.,Description of the ideal size of the breed varies. In Japan, the ideal size for males are described as 30\u201338 cm at the withers, with females somewhat smaller; (the Japanese standard is the one published by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale for international dog competitions.) In the UK, the Kennel Club describes the size as 34\u201337 cm (13.5\u201314.5 in) at the withers with females 30\u201334 cm (12\u201313.5 in), which is the same for the Australian National Kennel Council. In New Zealand (New Zealand Kennel Club), the ideal size is 30\u201340 cm (12\u201316 in) for males, 25\u201335 cm (10\u201314 in) for females. The Canadian Kennel Club states that the size for dogs is 12 inches (30 cm) with females slightly smaller, and the United Kennel Club in the U.S. describes the ideal size as 12 to 15 ins (30.5\u201338.1 cm) for males and 12 to 14 ins (30.5\u201335.6 cm) for females. Minor kennel clubs and other organizations may use any of these ideal sizes or create their own.

The depth of chest is approximately equal to one-half the height at the withers. The loin is also typically shorter.,Hudu or Hotgae: This type is more slender with a somewhat less depth of chest and a slightly longer loin. Moreover, other physical features tend to have an increased length, such as the ears, muzzle, and head. This results in an appearance that is longer than tall with the KNDA recommending a height at the withers to length ratio of 10:11.The KNDA also recognizes a third body type called Gakgol which is a gradually emerging combination of the two traditional types, retaining the length of body of the Hudu and the depth of chest of the Tonggol." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4bf" }, "breed": "Kerry Beagle", "origin": "Ireland", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_Beagle", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Kerry_Beagle_from_1915.JPG/220px-Kerry_Beagle_from_1915.JPG", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5efb" }, "breed": "Kerry Beagle", "contenido": "The Kerry Beagle (Irish: An Pocad\u00e1n Ciarra\u00edoch) is the only extant scent hound breed native to Ireland.,It is unclear why the name 'beagle' has been applied, as the Kerry Beagle is a medium-sized hound; height is between 56\u201361 cm (22\u201324 in), weight is up to 27 kg (60 lb), sharing little in common with the Beagle.

In 1903, the Kennel Club combined four separate toy spaniel breeds under this single title. The other varieties merged into this breed were the Blenheim, Ruby and Prince Charles Spaniels, each of which contributed one of the four colours available in the breed.,Thought to have originated in East Asia, toy spaniels were first seen in Europe during the 16th century. They became linked with English royalty in the time of Queen Mary I and were made famous by their association with King Charles II. Members of the breed were owned by Queen Victoria (Dash) and her great-granddaughter Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia.,The King Charles Spaniel and the other types of toy spaniels were crossbred with the Pug in the early 19th century to reduce the size of the nose, as was the style of the day. The 20th century saw attempts to restore lines of King Charles Spaniels to the breed of Charles II's time. These included the unsuccessful Toy Trawler Spaniel and the now popular Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. The Cavalier is slightly larger, with a flat head and a longer nose, while the King Charles is smaller, with a domed head and a flat face.,Historically the breeds that were merged into the King Charles Spaniel were used for hunting; due to their stature they were not well suited. They have kept their hunting instincts, but do not exhibit high energy and are better suited to being lapdogs. The modern breed is prone to several health problems, including cardiac conditions and a range of eye problems.,They may share a common ancestry with the Pekingese and Japanese Chin.The red and white variety of toy spaniel was first seen in paintings by Titian, including the Venus of Urbino (1538), where a small dog is used as a symbol of female seductiveness. Further paintings featuring these toy spaniels were created by Palma Vecchio and Paolo Veronese during the 16th century. These dogs already had high domed heads with short noses, although the muzzles were more pointed than they are today. These Italian toy spaniels may have been crossed with local small dogs such as the Maltese and also with imported Chinese dogs. The Papillon is the continental descendant of similar toy-sized spaniels.The earliest recorded appearance of a toy spaniel in England was in a painting of Queen Mary I and King Philip. Mary, Queen of Scots, was also fond of small toy dogs, including spaniels, showing the fondness of the British royalty for these types of dogs before Charles II.King Henry III of France owned a number of small spaniels, which were called Damarets. Although one of the translations of John Caius' 1570 Latin work De Canibus Britannicis talks of \"a new type of Spaniel brought out of France, rare, strange, and hard to get\", this was an addition in a later translation, and was not in the original text. Caius did discuss the \"Spainel-gentle, or Comforter\" though, which he classified as a delicate thoroughbred. This spaniel was thought to originate from Malta and was sought out only as a lapdog for \"daintie dames\".Captain John Saris may have brought back examples of toy spaniels from his voyage to Japan in 1613, a theory proposed by Commodore Matthew C. Perry during his expeditions to Japan on behalf of the United States in the mid-19th century. He noted that dogs were a common gift and thought that the earlier voyage of Captain Saris introduced a Japanese type of spaniel into England.,In the 17th century, toy spaniels began to feature in paintings by Dutch artists such as Caspar Netscher and Peter Paul Rubens. Spanish artists, including Juan de Vald\u00e9s Leal and Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, also depicted them; in the Spanish works, the dogs were tricolour, black and white or entirely white. French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon would later describe these types of dogs as crosses between spaniels and Pugs.King Charles II of England was very fond of the toy spaniel, which is why the dogs now carry his name, although there is no evidence that the modern breeds are descended from his particular dogs. He is credited with causing an increase in popularity of the breed during this period. Samuel Pepys' diary describes how the spaniels were allowed to roam anywhere in Whitehall Palace, including during state occasions. In an entry dated 1 September 1666, describing a council meeting, Pepys wrote, \"All I observed there was the silliness of the King, playing with his dog all the while and not minding the business.\" Charles' sister Princess Henrietta was painted by Pierre Mignard holding a small red and white toy-sized spaniel. Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth, writing in her 1911 work Toy Dogs and Their Ancestors, theorised that after Henrietta's death at the age of 26 in 1670, Charles took her dogs for himself." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4ca" }, "breed": "Kuchi", "origin": "Afghanistan", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuchi_dog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Afghan_Shepherd.jpg/220px-Afghan_Shepherd.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f08" }, "breed": "Kuchi", "contenido": "The Kuchi Dog, also known as the Afghan Shepherd, is an Afghan livestock guardian dog, taking its name from the Kuchi people of Afghanistan. It is a working dog following the nomads, protecting caravans and flocks of sheep, goats, camels and other livestock from wolves, big cats and thieves. ,Sage Kuchi or Sage Jangi is the standard Persian name and the Pashto name is De Kochyano Spai or Jangi Spai, meaning \"Dog of the Nomads\" and \"Fighter Dog\". It is found around the central and northern parts of Afghanistan. A   livestock guardian dog of  Molossoid type, the Kuchi dog shares a similar genetic background to the Alabai (Central Asian Shepherd). ,Because intricately associated with nomad life in remote and rugged regions where Western breeding techniques are not used, it is difficult to identify a \"true\" Kuchi type dog.  Warfare and general unrest in the region have also affected the Kuchi people, many of whom have settled around cities, creating ample opportunity for the Kuchi to interbreed with other dogs. There is no organizing body for dogs in Afghanistan or some Kuchi dogs have been exported to Europe.,The Kuchi dog breed possesses a very rich gene pool and the dogs adapt well to varying environments. It also means that gene expression can vary greatly from one individual to another.  For that reason, it is often difficult for an unaccustomed observer to determine what makes a particular dog a true Kuchi dog, or what type of a Kuchi dog it is.,In general, the Kuchi dog is large, often giant dogs, with a coat that can be short, medium, or long, backed by thick underwool.  They vary in height, reaching from 23 to 26 inches (58 to 66 cm) at the withers for the females and from 24 to 29 inches (61 to 74 cm) and more for the males.,Their weight ranges from about 84 to 120 pounds (38 to 54 kg) for the female dogs and from 88 to 176 pounds (40 to 80 kg) and more for the male dogs. It seems probable that the so-called \"dogs of Ghor\" should be included among these \"Kuchi dogs\":,\"The dogs of Ghor are mentioned in the earliest descriptions of the province and were always regarded as particularly special mastiffs. According to the Seljuk chronicles of the eleventh century, there was:'A remarkably fine breed of dogs in Ghor so powerful that in frame and strength every one of them is a match for a lion.' ,The king of the Turquoise Mountain had two Ghor dogs, one named after him and one after the ruler of Ghazni. He would make them fight. It was dangerous to be around him on days when his namesake lost. These dogs formed part of the tribute from the Ghorids to the Seljuk and became such proverbial parts of Islamic culture that a medieval scholar is recorded as saying that 'Avicenna could not fight with a dog from Ghor'.,The shape of the head of a Kuchi dog can vary from a wedge-type head to a brick-type or a bear-type skull, the last one being associated mainly with the dogs of the mountain variety. Their tails are usually docked by about one-third of their length and usually point straight up or at a slight angle. Traditionally, their ears are cropped, almost to the very base.,The Kuchi dogs are tall dogs, with a straight backline, which usually forms a square profile with the front and hind legs. The neck is usually long and thick, with plenty of excess skin hanging from the base of the jaw to the chest. The head is carried horizontally, or at a slight downward angle, with eyes staring straight ahead. The muzzle is dry and muscular.,Their body is often covered with dark spots that do not show through the coat. These spots can also cover the inside of the mouth, the bridge of the nose and the abdomen. The color of the coat comes in many varieties and is of no importance to determine the breed or the type of Kuchi dog. Neither is the length or structure of the hair. Most often, a strip of longer, more wiry hair covers the entire length of the backline, while the neck area is packed with thick and slippery underwool, as well as hair that is slightly longer than over the rest of the body." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4cb" }, "breed": "Kuvasz", "origin": "Hungary", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuvasz", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Kuvasz_named_Kan.jpg/220px-Kuvasz_named_Kan.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6b8" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/kuvasz.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 5, "trainability": 5, "energy": 3, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 12, "max_height_male": 30, "max_height_female": 30, "max_weight_male": 115, "max_weight_female": 90, "min_height_male": 28, "min_height_female": 28, "min_weight_male": 100, "min_weight_female": 70, "breed": "Kuvasz" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f0a" }, "breed": "Kuvasz", "contenido": "The Kuvasz is a traditional Hungarian breed of flock guardian dog.

They have historically been royal guard dogs, or guarded livestock, but have been increasingly found in homes as pets over the last seventy years. The American Kennel Club includes the breed in the working dog group.,During the Migration Period and later Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin, numerous nomadic or semi-nomadic tribes moved into the area that is now Hungary. The Principality of Hungary was founded in 895 or 896 AD. The Magyars probably brought sheep and dogs with them, and established a pastoral culture in the  Hungarian plains.:\u200a92\u200aIn the fifteenth century Matthias Corvinus is believed to have kept large numbers of Kuvasz dogs at his court as guard dogs or hunting dogs, or sometimes as war dogs.:\u200a92\u200aSelective breeding of the Kuvasz as a breed began in the latter part of the nineteenth century, and a breed standard was drawn up.:\u200a92\u200a In 1934 it was accepted by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale,:\u200a92\u200a which lists the date of full acceptance as 1954.By the end of World War II, nearly all the Kuvasz dogs in Hungary had been killed. The dogs had such a reputation for protecting their families that they were actively sought and killed by German and Soviet soldiers, while at the same time some German officers used to take Kuvasz dogs home with them.  After the Soviet invasion and the end of the war, the breed was nearly extinct in Hungary. After the war, it was revealed that fewer than thirty Kuvasz were left in Hungary and some sources indicate the number may have been as few as twelve. Since then, due to many dedicated breeders, Kuvasz breed have repopulated Hungary.  However, as a result of this near extinction, the genetic pool available to breeders was severely restricted and there is conjecture that some may have used other breeds, such as the Great Pyrenees, to continue their programs.In Romania, a breed-specific legislation specifies that Kuvasz must be muzzled when in public places.,The Kuvasz is a large and powerful dog: dogs stand some 71\u201376 cm at the withers, with weights in the range 48\u201362 kg; bitches may stand 66\u201370 cm and weigh 37\u201350 kg.The coat is white or ivory-white; it is thick and coarse, with a soft undercoat.

In 2018 the Ente Nazionale della Cinofilia Italiana recorded 2207 new registrations.,The Lagotto is of small to medium size, rarely over 50 cm at the withers, powerfully built and of rustic appearance. It is roughly square in outline, the body length more or less equal to the height. The coat is thick, wool-like and tightly curled into ringlets. It may be completely off-white, or off-white with orange or brown patches or roaning, or solid orange or brown either with or without white markings.A Lagotto usually lives for about fifteen years.

The breed was also mentioned in the Statutes of Lithuania (1588). Once a popular breed in Lithuania, the population decreased to 78 individuals after World War II. Thanks to several enthusiasts, the hound was revived and standardized. The provisional standard was established in 1966 and revised in 1983.

The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.,It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion dog, and according to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations in 2013.,During the 1890s, attempts were being made to standardise dog breeds. Dogs were being bred to preserve traits that assisted in their job of herding sheep and protecting their flocks from predators. In Germany this was practised within local communities, where shepherds selected and bred dogs. It was recognised that the breed had the necessary skills for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen senses of smell. The results were dogs that were able to do such things, but that differed significantly, both in appearance and ability, from one locality to another.To combat these differences, the Phylax Society was formed in 1891 with the intention of creating standardised development plans for native dog breeds in Germany. The society disbanded after only three years due to ongoing internal conflicts regarding the traits in dogs that the society should promote; some members believed dogs should be bred solely for working purposes, while others believed dogs should be bred also for appearance. While unsuccessful in their goal, the Phylax Society had inspired people to pursue standardising dog breeds independently.,With the rise of large, industrialised cities in Germany, the predator population began to decline, rendering sheepdogs unnecessary. At the same time, the awareness of sheepdogs as a versatile, intelligent class of canine began to rise. Max von Stephanitz, an ex-cavalry captain and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was an ex-member of the Phylax Society who firmly believed dogs should be bred for working. He admired the intelligence, strength and ability of Germany's native sheepdogs, but could not find any one single breed that satisfied him as the perfect working dog.In 1899, von Stephanitz was attending a dog show when he was shown a dog named Hektor Linksrhein. Hektor was the product of few generations of selective breeding and completely fulfilled what von Stephanitz believed a working dog should be. He was pleased with the strength of the dog and was so taken by the animal's intelligence, loyalty, and beauty, that he purchased him immediately. After purchasing the dog he changed his name to Horand von Grafrath and von Stephanitz founded the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde (Society for German Shepherd Dogs). Horand was declared to be the first German Shepherd Dog, and was the first dog added to the society's breed register. In just a few decades of the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde's establishment, the breed became one of the world's most popular and numerous, a position it has maintained to this day. By 1923, the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde claimed 50,000 dues-paying members in more than 500 branches in Germany alone.Horand became the center-point of the breeding programs and was bred with dogs belonging to other society members that displayed desirable traits and with dogs from Thuringia, Franconia, and W\u00fcrttemberg. Fathering many pups, Horand's most prolific was Hektor von Schwaben. Hektor was inbred with another of Horand's offspring and produced Heinz von Starkenburg, Beowulf, and Pilot, who later sired a total of 84 pups, mostly through being inbred with Hektor's other offspring. This inbreeding was deemed necessary in order to fix the traits being sought in the breed. Beowulf's progeny also were inbred and it is from these pups that all German shepherds draw a genetic link. It is believed the society accomplished its goal mostly due to von Stephanitz's strong, uncompromising leadership and he is therefore credited with being the creator of the German Shepherd Dog.During the first half of the twentieth century, the breed came to be strongly identified with Imperial and Nazi Germany, because of its association with purity and militarism. German shepherds were coveted as \"germanische Urhunde\", being close to the wolf, and became very fashionable during the Nazi era. Adolf Hitler acquired a German Shepherd named \"Prinz\" in 1921, during his years of poverty, but he had been forced to lodge the dog elsewhere. However, she managed to escape and return to him. Hitler, who adored the loyalty and obedience of the dog, thereafter developed a great liking for the breed. Hitler kept several more of the breed, including Blondi, who was among several dogs in the 'F\u00fchrerbunker' during the Battle of Berlin at the end of the Second World War. Dogs played a role in Nazi propaganda by portraying Hitler as an animal lover. Preparing for his suicide, Hitler ordered Dr. Werner Haase to test a cyanide capsule on Blondi, and the dog died as a result. Erna Flegel, a nurse who worked at the emergency casualty station in the Reich Chancellery stated in 2005 that Blondi's death had affected the people in the bunker more than Eva Braun's suicide. German Shepherds were also used widely as guard dogs at Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust.When the German Shepherd was introduced to the United States it was initially a popular dog. But as the dogs' popularity grew, it became associated as a dangerous breed owned by gangsters and bootleggers. The reputation of the German shepherds as a dangerous breed had grown to such an extent that it was briefly banned to import them in Australia in 1929. Potential legislation was even considered to require that all German shepherds in South Australia be sterilised.,The breed was named Deutscher Sch\u00e4ferhund, by von Stephanitz, literally translating to \"German Shepherd Dog\".  At the time, all other herding dogs in Germany were referred to by this name; they thus became known as Altdeutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde, or Old German herding dogs.,The direct translation of the name was adopted for use in the stud-book; however, at the end of the First World War, it was believed that the inclusion of the word \"German\" would harm the breed's popularity, due to the anti-German sentiment of the era. The breed was officially renamed by the UK Kennel Club to \"Alsatian Wolf Dog\", after the French region of Alsace bordering Germany.Eventually, the appendage \"wolf dog\" was dropped, after numerous campaigns by breeders who were worried that becoming known as a wolf-dog hybrid would affect the breed's popularity and legality. The name Alsatian remained for five decades, until 1977, when successful campaigns by dog enthusiasts pressured the British kennel clubs to allow the breed to be registered again as German Shepherds. The word \"Alsatian\" once appeared in parentheses as part of the formal breed name of the American Kennel Club and was removed in 2010." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4d5" }, "breed": "Mackenzie River husky", "origin": "United States", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackenzie_River_husky", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/MackenzieRiverHusky.jpg/220px-MackenzieRiverHusky.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f1a" }, "breed": "Mackenzie River husky", "contenido": "The term Mackenzie River husky describes several overlapping local populations of Arctic and sub-Arctic sled dog-type dogs, none of which constitutes a breed.

Parti-coloured and solid-coloured dogs were accepted in the show ring from 1902 until 1913 in England, and as late as 1950 in Victoria, Australia.,The Maltese dog was a lapdog favoured by both the ancient Greeks and Romans, especially their children, and appears on amphorae with the word \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1\u03af\u03b5 (Melitaie). References to the dog can also be found in Ancient Greek and Roman literature. Aristotle mentions the dog around 370 BC. Some ancient writers attribute its origin to the island of Malta in the Mediterranean, called Melita in Latin, others claim it to be from the island of Mljet off the coast of Croatia, also called Melita in Latin.:\u200a63\u200a:\u200a347\u200aPliny suggests the dog as having taken its name from the Adriatic island Mljet (also Melita in Latin), however Strabo, in the early first century AD, identifies the breed as originating from the Mediterranean island of Malta.During the first century, the Roman poet Martial wrote descriptive verses to a lap dog named \"Issa\" owned by his friend Publius. It is proposed that Issa was a Maltese dog, and various sources link Martial's friend Publius with the Roman Governor Publius of Malta, though others do not identify him.John Caius, physician to Queen Elizabeth I, also claimed that Callimachus was referring to the island of Melita \"in the Sicilian strait\" (Malta). This claim is often repeated, especially by English writers. The dog's links to Malta are mentioned in the writings of Abb\u00e9 Jean Quintin, Secretary to the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, in his work Insulae Melitae Descriptio.English writers in the early twentieth century also gave Malta as the place of origin of the breed.,The coat is dense, glossy, silky and shiny, falling heavily along the body without curls or an undercoat.

He noticed local tribal people called Bedar (Fearless); also called Berad (not - crying) using these hounds for hunting. Using selective breeding, he was able to restore the royal Mudhol hound. On a visit to England in the early 1900s, the Maharaja of Mudhol State presented King George V a pair of hounds, which popularized the Mudhol hound breed.The Indian Army has expressed its desire to use the Mudhol sight hound for surveillance and border protection duties. It has obtained six Mudhol dogs for testing at the  Army's Remount Veterinary Corps at Meerut.

Selection of the breed was begun in 1947 by Piero Scanziani, who had seen one at an exhibition in Naples in 1946. He drew up the first standard, which in 1949 was officially recognised by the Ente Nazionale della Cinofilia Italiana.

The breed was favored by royalty of the Chinese Imperial court as both a lap dog and companion dog, and its name refers to the city of Peking (Beijing) where the Forbidden City is located. The breed has several characteristics and health issues related to its unique appearance. Because of its desirable characteristics, the Pekingese has been part of the development of designer crossbreeds, such as the Peekapoo (crossed with a poodle) and Peke-a-tese (crossed with a Maltese).,Modern breeders and dog show judges seem to prefer the long-haired type over the more traditional spaniel-type coat.,The Pekingese's flat face and large eyes are some of the breeds most obvious characteristics.  The body is compact and low to the ground. Pekingese also have a muscular and durable body. The breed's unusual rolling gait may have been deliberately developed by breeding to prevent the court dogs from wandering in ancient times.,All breed standards allow a wide range of color combinations. The majority of Pekingese are gold, red or sable. Cream, black, white, tan, black and tan and occasionally 'blue' or slate grey have appeared in the breed. The latter often has poor pigment and light eyes. Albino Pekingese (white with pink eyes) should not be bred due to health problems that have been associated with albinism.,A black mask or a self-colored face is equally acceptable in show dogs.

It was originally bred by Dr. David Brian Plummer to hunt vermin, especially rats. The breed, while unrecognized by any kennel club, is known for its rugged determination and hardiness.,In the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, Brian Plummer worked as a somewhat reluctant teacher of several schools throughout southern Yorkshire and the Midlands. He was already well-known in his local neighborhood for going around with a pack of terriers to catch rats, when he decided to create his own terrier breed in the 1970s. Well-versed in breeding, he strove to produce a unique strain of terrier by mixing the Jack Russell Terrier with the Beagle, Fell Terrier, and Bull Terrier.These terriers were worked hard and as the breed developed, so too did Plummer's reputation as a breeder of hardy terriers that bred true to type. Initially known as the Huddlesford Rat Pack, the breed is now named after him.,The Beagle introduced to Plummer's lines in the 1960s was out of Catherine Sutton's Rossut show-bred strain that originated from U.S. imports, brought to the U.K. to tidy up British exhibits. It was owned by Philip Ainsley, a fellow teacher friend of Plummer's.,Further outcrosses were introduced along the way. The addition of Fell Terrier blood, Jaeger from Nigel Hinchcliffe's lines and Flint from Brian Nuttall's lines, both noted working lines and most likely descending from Cyril Breay and Frank Buck's stock, infused refinement of shape and to a certain extent contributed to fixing type, like that seen in Pagan, a black and tan terrier, acknowledged as one of the early pillars of the breed.,Further additions included a Jack Russell terrier known as Errol Forsyth's Pip, Alan Thomas's Hamish, and Laddie from the Chiddingfold and Leconfield foxhound kennels. Performance as an earth dog was and is an essential prerequisite of most, if not all terrier breeds and Plummers are no exception to this rule. These three dogs were known to be full-on earth workers.,In the early 1980s, during one of the many TV documentaries (Rat hunting man and Lone furrow) about Plummer and his terriers, he said that one day he would like his terriers to be known as Plummer Terriers and recognised by the Kennel Club.,In 1985, he suffered a near-fatal heart attack which resulted in the dispersal of his substantial pack of terriers to friends. He eventually moved to a remote croft in Caithness, Scotland, and began to write full-time. By the early 1990s most of the pack's important gene pool was found and regrouped, albeit on a smaller scale. Work continued and other lines were sought; widening the gene pool enough to be able to limit inbreeding.,At this point, two distinct types began to develop, the smaller, more snipe-nosed type and the more bully, stronger-headed type. Plummer opted for the latter, and by the late 1990s decided that the breed needed a wider gene pool in order to reach its maximum potential. Bull Terrier blood of known ancestry was sought and outcrossed into the breed.,Plummer had cancer and died in September 2002. His work was carried on by others and the breed standard remains intact.,As a working terrier, the Plummer is a versatile dog, which has many uses. They are keen retrievers, most generally take to water freely; quite intelligent, have excellent noses, are biddable and have many uses in the field. They are often found ferreting; some are found in the beating line on local shoots; occasionally they are used to ground but undoubtedly they are most commonly used in a pack hunting rats." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c508" }, "breed": "Pointer", "origin": "England", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(dog_breed)", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/English_Pointer_orange-white.jpg/220px-English_Pointer_orange-white.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6da" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/pointer.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 5, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 4, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 5, "energy": 4, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 17, "max_height_male": 28, "max_height_female": 28, "max_weight_male": 75, "max_weight_female": 65, "min_height_male": 25, "min_height_female": 25, "min_weight_male": 55, "min_weight_female": 45, "breed": "Pointer" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f61" }, "breed": "Pointer", "contenido": "The Pointer, sometimes called the English Pointer, is a medium-sized breed of pointing dog developed in England. Pointers are used to find game for hunters, and are considered by gundog enthusiasts to be one of the finest breeds of its type; however, unlike most other pointing breeds, its purpose is to point, not retrieve game.,The popular belief is that the Pointer descends from the Old Spanish Pointer that was brought to England from Spain with returning soldiers at the beginning of the 18th century. Once in England, they were crossed with local dog breeds to improve the breed's hunting abilities.,The Pointer takes its name from the stance it adopts when it detects the scent of game, \"pointing\" at the hidden game as a visible signal to the hunter that it has found something and where it is; the breed is sometimes called the English Pointer to differentiate it from other pointing dog breeds. The term \"bird dog\" is usually used to describe all pointing dogs and setters, but in the United States the term is often used to describe the Pointer breed, particularly south of the Mason\u2013Dixon line.,There has been much debate among dog historians about the ancestry of the Pointer. The most commonly held position is that the breed descends from Old Spanish Pointers that were imported into England. The popular belief is that Spanish Pointers were first introduced to England in 1713 by soldiers returning from Spain after the Peace of Utrecht. In his Cynographia Britannica, published in 1800, Sydenham Edwards states that the \"Spanish Pointer was introduced to this country [England] by a Portugal Merchant, at a very modern period, and was first used by a reduced Baron, of the name of Bichell, who lived in Norfolk, and could shoot flying\".Other early sources suggest Portuguese Pointers, Italian Braccos or French pointers were the foundation of the English breed. In 1902, Victorian era sportsman William Arkwright produced the book The pointer and his predecessors often considered one of the best early histories of the Pointer for which he expended considerable time and money searching continental archives. In the book he notes that he did not find any truly convincing evidence of Spanish Pointers being the foundation stock of the Pointer but still concludes on the basis of all evidence that it is the most likely history. It is noteworthy that in those days dog breeds did not exist as they are known in more modern times, and that a more general pointing type of dog (typically a short haired, hound-like, air-scenting dog with regional variations of appearance that was used for indicating the location of game birds) was known in all of these countries.A second less commonly held belief is a form of Pointer that was present in England, much earlier than the introduction of the Spanish Pointer, and that they were used from medieval times to indicate the location of hares which were subsequently coursed by greyhounds or caught by hawks; it is held that these dogs were subsequently heavily influenced by the introduction of imported European pointer blood.The earliest recorded mentions of Pointers in England date from the early 18th century. John Gay mentions Pointers being used to hunt partridge in his 1713 poem Rural sports, and Peter Tillemans produced a painting of the Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull's kennel of pointers in 1725.A compendium of sources state that in England early Pointers were crossed with other breeds to impart certain desirable traits, including setters, bloodhounds and foxhounds, with some mention of Bull Terriers and bulldogs. Early Pointers were comparatively heavy, ponderous dogs able to hold a steady point whilst the hunter readied his gun. With the steady improvement of firearms throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, faster and more agile dogs were sought so Greyhounds were increasingly introduced to add speed. The introduction of Greyhound blood resulted in the modern Pointer being a much finer dog with a comparatively tucked-up loin, tighter lips and low-set tail, more akin to that of the Greyhound than European pointer breeds.The Pointer's breed standard was formally adopted in 1936 and has subsequently remained largely unchanged." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c50b" }, "breed": "Polish Hound", "origin": "Poland", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Hound", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/PolishHound-MlChPl-OKSANA-ZOstregoBoru-wl.JoannaZembrzuska_3.JPG/220px-PolishHound-MlChPl-OKSANA-ZOstregoBoru-wl.JoannaZembrzuska_3.JPG", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f64" }, "breed": "Polish Hound", "contenido": "The Polish Hound, commonly known as Ogar Polski, is a breed of hunting dog indigenous to Poland. The Polish Hound has a keen sense of smell. This heightened sense combined with the endurance needed to hunt in harsh environments led to its use in hunting, while its stature made it popular with Polish nobility.,The first description of the Polish (Ogar) Hound is found in the book The beginnings of the natural history and farming of the national domestic and wild animals by Krzysztof Kluk (1779). According to historians, the Polish Hounds developed through crossbreeding of Bloodhounds (the St Hubert Hound), imported to Poland in the Middle Ages, with local hounds. Jan Szytier (1819) wrote about the \"Polish Hound\" and the \"Polish Scent Hound\" in his \"Hunting Guide\" (Poradnik My\u015bliwych). World War II resulted in the decline of the Polish Hounds' population. The attempts to revive the breed led to the emergence of two types: light-boned (bred by Colonel J\u00f3zef Paw\u0142usiewicz) and heavier-boned (bred by Colonel Piotr Kartawik). The latter one was recognized by the FCI as the \"Ogar Polski\" in 1966.,Polish Hounds reach 55\u201365 cm (22-23.5 inches) in height.  Males weigh around 25 to 32 kg. (55-70.5 lb) while females weigh 20 to 26 kg (44-57.5 lb).,The Polish Hound has an average life span of 13 to 14 years. A medium-sized breed, Ogar Polski is often described as strong and sleek, with a powerful bone structure.  The coloration of these animals is often a combination of a brown underside and black on top running from the neck to the tail. The breed has thick double coat, which ensures water resistance on outer and underlying skin layers.  The Polish Hound's voice is often described as resonant and pure  which makes it an ideal hunting dog. The Polish Hound matures slowly.  Intelligent and easily trained, Polish Hounds are known to be calm, affectionate animals and great pets.  Friendly with other breeds and very loyal, these dogs are also very protective of their land.  It is unclear as to whether this breed makes a good guard dog.  Many argue that its territorial nature makes it defensive against intruders, while other state that its passive nature renders it harmless to new people.  Resilient to environment due to their origin of use, the Polish Hound acclimates quickly to new settings." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c50c" }, "breed": "Polish Lowland Sheepdog", "origin": "Poland", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Lowland_Sheepdog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Polski_owczarek_nizinny_rybnik-kamien_pl.jpg/220px-Polski_owczarek_nizinny_rybnik-kamien_pl.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6de" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/polish_lowland_sheepdog.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 2, "grooming": 4, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 5, "trainability": 4, "energy": 3, "barking": 4, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 14, "max_height_male": 20, "max_height_female": 20, "max_weight_male": 50, "max_weight_female": 50, "min_height_male": 18, "min_height_female": 18, "min_weight_male": 30, "min_weight_female": 30, "breed": "Polish Lowland Sheepdog" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f65" }, "breed": "Polish Lowland Sheepdog", "contenido": "The Polish Lowland Sheepdog (Polish: Polski Owczarek Nizinny, also PON), is a medium-sized, shaggy-coated, sheep dog breed native to Poland.,The PON is a muscular, thick-coated dog.

From there the breed expanded to all around Portugal's coast, where they were taught to herd fish into fishermen's nets, retrieve lost tackle or broken nets, and act as couriers from ship to ship, or ship to shore.,Portuguese Water Dogs rode in fishing trawlers as they worked their way from the Atlantic waters of Portugal to the waters off the coast of Iceland fishing for cod.In Portuguese, the breed is called c\u00e3o de \u00e1gua (IPA: [\u02c8k\u0250\u0303w d\u0268 \u02c8a\u0261w\u0250]; literally 'dog of water'). In Portugal, the dog is also known as the Algarvian Water Dog (c\u00e3o de \u00e1gua algarvio), or Portuguese Fishing Dog (c\u00e3o pescador portugu\u00eas). c\u00e3o de \u00e1gua de p\u00ealo ondulado is the name given to the wavy-haired variety, and c\u00e3o de \u00e1gua de p\u00ealo encaracolado is the name for the curly-coated variety.The Portuguese Water Dog is a fairly rare breed; only 36 Portuguese Water Dogs were entered for Britain's Crufts competition in 2013. Though some breeders claim they are a hypoallergenic dog breed, there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that hypoallergenic dog breeds exist. Their non-shedding qualities have made them more popular in recent years.,The Portuguese Water Dog has recently gained more fame by being the chosen breed of US President Barack Obama, who had two of them, Bo and Sunny. The Obama family chose Sunny for the breed's comparatively hypoallergenic nature, while Bo was given to them by Senator Ted Kennedy.,Portuguese and Spanish water dogs are clearly related and probably have a common ancestor. The closest relatives of the PWD and Spanish Water dog are widely thought to be the Standard Poodle. Like Poodles and several other water dog breeds, PWDs are intelligent, can have curly coats, have webbed toes for swimming, and do not shed. However, Portuguese Water Dogs are more robustly built, with stout legs, and can have a wavy coat instead of tightly curled. If comparing the structure to that of a Poodle, there are significant differences between the two breeds. The Portuguese Water Dog is built of strong substantial bone; well developed, neither refined nor coarse, and a solidly built, muscular body. The Portuguese Water Dog is off-square, slightly longer than tall when measured from prosternum to rearmost point of the buttocks, and from withers to ground. Portuguese Water Dog eyes are black or various tones of brown, and their coats can be black, brown, black and white or brown and white.,Male Portuguese Water Dogs usually grow to be about 20 to 23 inches (51 to 58 cm) tall, and they weigh between 40 and 60 pounds (18 and 27 kg), while the females usually grow to be about 17 to 21 inches (43 to 53 cm) tall, and they weigh between 35 and 50 pounds (16 and 23 kg).,PWDs have a single-layered coat that does not shed (see Moult), and therefore their presence is tolerated well among many people who suffer from dog allergies. Persons with dog allergies, however, should consult their medical advisor before considering the purchase of any dog.Most PWDs, especially those shown in conformation shows, are entirely black, black and white, brown, or silver-tipped; it is common to see white chest spots and white paws or legs on black or brown coated dogs. \"Parti\" or \"Irish-marked\" coats, with irregular white and black spots, are rare but visually striking. \"Parti\" dogs are becoming more common in the United States. However, in Portugal, the breed standard does not allow more than 30% white markings. Overall, white is the least common Portuguese Water Dog color, while black with white markings on the chin (\"milk chin\") and the chest is the most common color.,From the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America Revised Standard for the Portuguese Water Dog come these descriptions of the two coat types:,Curly coat: \"Compact, cylindrical curls, somewhat lusterless. The hair on the ears is sometimes wavy.\"" }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c515" }, "breed": "Posavac Hound", "origin": "Croatia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posavac_Hound", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Posavac_hound_female_%28cropped%29.jpg/220px-Posavac_hound_female_%28cropped%29.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f6f" }, "breed": "Posavac Hound", "contenido": "The Posavac Hound (FCI No. 154) (Croatian: posavski goni\u010d) is a breed of dog, originating as a hunting dog of the scenthound type.

The name translates into English as the Scenthound From The Sava Valley, but is usually translated as the Posavac Hound.,The Posavac Hound is a solidly built dog with a somewhat long body, close-fitting drop ears, a long tail, and a gentle expression. The breed has an ideal height around 50 cm (20 ins) at the withers. The short, flat coat is slightly longer on the belly and backs of legs (feathering). Coat colour is a reddish wheaten, marked with white.,There is no actual proof of great antiquity for this breed, although there is much fanciful conjecture. The type is very old, and the modern breed resembles images seen in frescoes as early as 1497. Writers cited as having mentioned the type include Bishop of \u0110akovo Petar Baki\u0107 in 1719 and the veterinarian Franjo Berti\u0107, also of \u0110akovo, in 1859. Hounds from the Sava Valley (Posavina, south-east of Zagreb) were sold as boskini in Croatia in the 1800s. The ancestry of the dogs was documented starting in 1929, when registrations for the stud book were first taken. The breed was internationally recognised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 1955, and the name was clarified in 1969. The breed has been known since then as the Posavac Hound.The breed is recognised in North America by the United Kennel Club in the Scenthound Group, and by a number of minor registries, hunting clubs, and internet-based dog registry businesses, and is promoted as a rare breed for those seeking a unique pet.,No unusual diseases or claims of extraordinary health have been documented for this breed.

They are versatile stock dogs equally adept at gathering, driving and keeping stock under control. They have a long head with semi-erect ears, a whimsical expression, and a tail that forms a circle over the back. The coat (black, white, grey, or fawn) is a combination of wavy and curly hair forming curls all over the body.,The Pumi is considered to have arisen from the cross-breeding of Hungarian Puli with French and German herding dogs from the 17th century onwards. The international breed standard was approved in 1935.  The Pumi became an officially recognised breed in the US in 2011 and in the UK in 2015.  There are over 2,000 Pumis registered in Hungary, with notable populations in Finland and Sweden and small but growing numbers of registrations in the US, UK and Germany.,Some refer to the Pumi as the \"Hungarian herding terrier\" because it has some terrier-like attributes such as quick movement, alert temperament, and a quadratic, lean and muscular body type.,Pumis can be in varying shades of grey, white, or fawn (known as 'fako' in Hungary).  Grey Pumis are the most common, born black, and ranging from almost black to light grey in adulthood.  Puppies usually start greying at six to eight weeks old and the shade progressively lightens. The final shade is predicted by the colour of the parents. Other accepted colours are black, white, and cream to red with a darker mask, known as fawn with mask.  An analysis of 1023 Pumi puppies carried out in 2009 by the University of Debrecen found that 56% were born black turning grey, 14% were black, 13% white, 11% grey, and 4% are fawn-coloured. Brown, mottled or blue-merle-coloured puppies are born occasionally.The thick coat is curly and of medium length approximately 4\u20137 cm (1.5\u20133 inches) long and consisting of a harsh topcoat and soft undercoat, which provides good insulation and enables the dog to tolerate extremes of weather. The coat is maintained by combing every few weeks, and trimming every two to four months. The coat grows constantly (similar to that of the Poodle) and, if grooming is not maintained, it may start matting. The breed has little to no shedding. The Pumi is known for its alert and lively ears, which are high-set and carried semi-erect and with longer hair than the body.The Pumi is a square, light-bodied dog which looks somewhat larger because of its thick coat with a long, narrow head. The muzzle is 45% of the length of the head, which is of equal length to the neck. The stop is barely noticeable, and the skull is flat when seen from the side. The eyes are small, dark, and slightly oblique. Movements are lively and energetic as is the Pumi itself.Male Pumis stand 41 to 47 cm (16 to 19 in) at the withers and weigh 10 to 15 kg (22 to 33 lb); bitches are 38 to 44 cm (15 to 17 in) and weigh 8 to 13 kg (18 to 29 lb)." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c51c" }, "breed": "Pungsan dog", "origin": "Korea", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pungsan_dog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Poongsandogs.JPG/220px-Poongsandogs.JPG", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f76" }, "breed": "Pungsan dog", "contenido": "The Pungsan or Poongsan (Chosongul: \ud48d\uc0b0\uac1c; Hanja: \u8c50\u5c71\uac1c) is a breed of hunting dog from Korea, named for originating in Kim Hyong Gwon County, formerly Phungsan county. They were bred in the Kaema highlands of what is now North Korea, and were traditionally used as hunting dogs. The dog is a rare breed, and is sometimes smuggled over the North Korea\u2013China border. The dog was made a national monument of North Korea in April 1956, and the national dog of the DPRK in 2014.,According to NK News, international kennel clubs consider Pungsan dogs as \"little more than a local Spitz-type variant of Siberian huskies, only less physically impressive and with behavioral issues\".,According to the Encyclopedia of Korean Culture by the Academy of Korean Studies under the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (South Korea) of the South Korean government, the Pungsan dog was first recognized as a national symbol in the Korean peninsula during the Japanese colonial period. The breed was also used in Russia to hunt tigers, bears, and warthogs. The Pungsan dog breed was bred for a long time in isolation from other provinces.During the 2000 inter-Korean summit, North Korean leader Kim Jong-il made a gift of two Pungsan dogs (associated with the North) to South Korean president Kim Dae-jung. In return, Kim Dae-jung gave two Jindo dogs (associated with the South) to Kim Jong-il. Born at the Pyongyang Central Zoo, the Pungsan dogs were originally named Dangyol (Unity) and Jaju (Independence), but were later renamed Uri (meaning We) and Duri (Two). They initially lived in the Blue House, the residence of the South Korean president, before being moved to the Seoul Zoo, where they gave birth to 15 puppies before both dying at age 13. During their lives, the dogs were accorded special status as guests of the state.At the Pyongyang summit in 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un gave two Pungsan dogs to South Korean President Moon Jae-in. The male was named Songkang, and the female was named Gomi.

Rajapalayam is a town in the Virudhunagar district of Tamil Nadu.,Four commemorative postage stamps were issued on 9 January 2005 by India Post for four breeds, that is, Himalayan Sheepdog, Rampur Hound, Mudhol Hound (Face value \u20b9 5 each) and Rajapalayam (Face value \u20b9 15). Rajapalayam dog is known to live up to 12 years of age.,It is a large dog, usually measuring about 65\u201375 cm (25\u201330 inches) at the withers and weighs 30 \u2013 45 kg Mostly found in the centre of Tamil nadu, the Rajapalayam was bred to be the complete hunter and estate guardian with features that allow it to excel.  Primarily used to hunt wild boar independent of the handler, the Rajapalayam is unique in two ways. Firstly it fulfils the functions of a bay dog as well as a catch dog, secondly the Rajapalayam can hunt by sight as well as track by scent.  While hunting they can be relentless pursuers that are not intimidated by complex terrain or water bodies. After finding their prey, the dogs take it down and bring it back to the handler. If the dog is unable to bring down its prey, it injures and corners the target till the handler can get to it. This dog can hunt alone, in pairs, in a pack, or with its owner.,Rajapalayams tend to be more muscular and heavier boned than most sighthounds, but they  share the depth of chest and basic body structure that exudes speed and physical ability. Its facial structure is considerably different from that of a Caravan Hound with a slightly larger head and more powerful jaws. It has a slightly curled tail.,An extremely handsome and graceful dog, the Rajapalayam has a double suspension gait, similar to the trotting of a thoroughbred horse. The staple colour is milk white though faint brown markings are quite common, the pink nose is standard.,Eye color can range from golden to brown and green. Puppies born with whitish or blue eyes are almost always deaf and should not be bred. The coat is single, short, and fine so these dogs don't do well in very cold climates but excel in the heat of South India or tropics. ,Many Rajapalayam dogs suffer from mange, though this is usually not a serious problem, (Mange is not a skin problem and is actually caused by mites), so it is basically a care issue of preventing mites rather than a breed issue. Other than this the breed is robust and requires minimal maintenance.,Rajapalayam dogs have a pink nose, button ears, whiptail and golden eyes. They have a gait similar to that of a horse and were also used during the Carnatic Wars and Polygar war against the British cavalry. They aren\u2019t fast runners but are tireless and steady over long distances. There were also some reports that the Indian Army in Kashmir had them as guard dogs.

They share much ancestry with the small hunting dogs known as feists. Common throughout family farms in the 1920s and 1930s, they are now recognized by the United and American Kennel Clubs and are considered a rare breed.  Today's Rat Terrier is an intelligent and active small dog that is kept both for pest control and as a family pet.,The Rat Terrier ranges from about 10 to 25 pounds (4.5 to 11.3 kg) and stands 10 to 18 inches (25 to 46 cm) at the shoulder. The miniature size \u2013 13 inches (33 cm) and under as defined by the UKC \u2013 is becoming increasingly popular as a house pet and companion dog, but the miniature is still a hunting dog. The standard says \"small to medium\"  and the miniature is small enough to go in and under those places where vermin like to hide. A larger strain, often in excess of 25 pounds (11 kg), has been developed. Called the Decker or Decker Giant, it was named after breeder Milton Decker who created a larger hunting companion and are recognized by the National Rat Terrier Association (NRTA, see \"Breed recognition\" below). UKC and AKC do not recognize the Decker strain as another breed; they are merely considered a standard variety. The NRTA recognizes a Toy variety weighing 10 pounds (4.5 kg) or less. The NRTA continues to classify the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier as the Type B Rat Terrier. In the 1970s, a hairless mutation appeared in a single Rat Terrier and was propagated into a strain of the Rat Terrier.  After a period of development this line resulted in the American Hairless Terrier, recognized as a separate breed by several registries.,The Rat Terrier comes in a variety of coat colors. The classic coloring is black tan point with piebald spotting (known as black tricolor), but chocolate, tan (varying in shade from pale gold to dark mahogany), blue, isabella (pearl), lemon and apricot are all fairly common. They may be tricolor or bicolor, always with some amount of white present. Sable may overlay any of these colors. Creeping tan (often \"Calico\"), is also acceptable. Ticking is usually visible in the white parts of the coat, or in the underlying skin. Brindle, currently disallowed by the main breed standards, is considered by some to be a traditional Rat Terrier pattern, and there is a growing movement to have this pattern accepted into the breed. However, merle is widely considered to be the result of recent outcrosses and, because of associated health problems, is rejected by most Rat Terrier breeders. ,Ear carriage is erect, but can also be tipped, or button, all of which contribute to an intelligent, alert expression. The tail has been traditionally docked to about 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm), but the bobtail gene is very common in Rat Terriers and can result in a variety of tail lengths. Today, some breeders prefer a natural, undocked tail, which is accepted in the breed standards.,Rat Terriers tend to be both intelligent and stubborn, knowing how to get what they want when they want it. They are also considered good family pets because of their energy and compatibility with kids.

The breed is recognised by numerous minor kennel clubs - such as the Nordic Kennel Union - and dog registries, especially in North America.

It may be used to hunt raccoon, deer, bear, boar, cougar, or other large game. It originated in the Southern United States, and derives from foxhounds brought by immigrants from Scotland. It is characterized by its deep red coat.,It has been registered with the United Kennel Club since 1902, and with the American Kennel Club since 2009.,In the early 19th century, Scottish immigrants brought red-colored foxhounds to Georgia, which would later become the foundation stock of today's modern-day Redbone. Around 1840, Irish-bred Foxhound and Bloodhound lines were added. The Redbone name comes from an early breeder, Peter Redbone of Tennessee, though the United Kennel Club credits Redbone's contemporary, George F.L. Birdsong of Georgia, and Dr. Thomas Henry in the 19th century.Over time, breeders followed a selective program that led to a coonhound that was adept at treeing wild-game, was courageous against larger animals such as bear and mountain lions, agile enough to track in the mountains or in the marsh, and could swim if necessary (one of the few hounds with webbed feet). They are ideal for pack hunting of both small and larger prey. Originally, the Redbone had a black saddleback, but by the beginning of the 20th century, it was replaced by an uninterrupted red tone.The Redbone Coonhound was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1902, becoming the second coonhound breed to gain recognition and was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 2010.,The Redbone Coonhound has a lean, muscular, well proportioned build. The body type is typical to the coonhounds subgroup, with long straight legs, a deep chest, and a head and tail that are held high and proud when hunting or showing. The Redbone Coonhound has brown eyes and a face that is often described as having a pleading expression. The dog's eyes may be dark brown to hazel, but a darker color is preferred. The coat is short and smooth against the body, but coarse enough to provide protection to the skin while hunting through dense underbrush. Their large paws have especially thick pads, with webbed toes, and dewclaws are common. The nose is often black and prominent, with black on the muzzle and around the eyes, called \"masking\", not uncommon. The ears are floppy and will most likely extend to nearly the end of the nose if stretched out. The coat color is always a rich red, though a small amount of white on the chest, between the legs, or on the feet is sometimes seen. The white chest and feet markings that occasionally appear on Redbone Coonhound puppies today is most likely a throwback to the mixing of Bloodhound and Foxhound bloodlines. Males tend to be 22-27 inches (56-68.5 cm) at the shoulder, with females slightly shorter at 21-26 inches (53\u201366 cm). Weight should be proportional to the size and bone structure of the individual dogs, with a preference towards leaner working dogs rather than heavier dogs. Generally, weights will range from 45 to 70 lb. (20.5 to 31.75 kg).It is affectionate, gentle, and likes to please its owner." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c52c" }, "breed": "Russian Spaniel", "origin": "Union of Soviet Socialist Republics", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Spaniel", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Rosyjski_spaniel_my%C5%9Bliwski_MB_01.jpg/220px-Rosyjski_spaniel_my%C5%9Bliwski_MB_01.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f8a" }, "breed": "Russian Spaniel", "contenido": "The Russian Spaniel is a type of spaniel first standardised in 1951 in the Soviet Union after World War II by cross breeding English Cocker Spaniels, English Springer Spaniels and other spaniel breeds. In 1951, the standard of the Russian spaniel was adopted, the selection of dogs for breeding began to be carried out in accordance with the requirements. Physically it is similar to a Cocker Spaniel, but has a shorter, tighter coat and a longer body. Developed and used as hunting dogs, this breed does not suffer from any major health complaints other than those normally associated with spaniels. It is the only gun dog breed originated in Russia. It is used for hunting game birds (marsh, field, upland and waterfowl birds) and hares. Popular in its native Russia, the breed was only introduced overseas in the 1990s, and is not yet recognised by any major kennel clubs, but is recognised by Russian Kynological Federation.,The Russian Spaniel is a small, sturdy dog with a short, tight, silky coat with feathering on the ears and legs. Colors can vary greatly, and can include solid colors without white markings, piebald, speckled, black and tan, and combinations. The head and ears are also usually dark.,The Russian Spaniel resembles the English Cocker Spaniel, with a body similar to the field lines of that breed though with the longer ears of the show line. The body of the Russian Spaniel tends to be longer than that of the English Cocker however, and the breed has only one line rather than being split into separate specific show and field lines of the same breed.Both the male and females of the breed weigh on average 28\u201340 lb (13\u201318 kg) and are around 15\u201317 inches (38\u201343 cm) at the withers. This makes them similar in size or a little larger than the English Cocker Spaniel which weighs approximately 13\u201314.5 kg (29\u201332 lb) and is on average between 15.5 and 16 inches (39 and 41 cm) with the females being a little smaller at 15\u201315.5 inches (38\u201339 cm).Bred primarily as hunting dogs, their goal is to find the bird, send it into the air and then to retrieve it on command after the hunter has shot the quarry. The Russian Spaniel is suited for hunting in marshland, fields, woodland, for birds as well as rabbits and other small game. The breed is also popular in their native Russia as their small size makes them suitable to be kept in busy cities, and easily transported to hunting sites.,As with all long-eared spaniels, Russian Spaniels require checks to prevent ear infections. The breed does have an inclination to gain weight easily, which can be prevented by controlling food intake. The Russian Spaniel can be prone to food allergies, which are usually identified at between 1 and 5 months of age with the most common allergens being chicken and carrots. There are no other breed-specific health issues currently known.,It is an energetic, free-spirited breed. Even though it is a gundog, it is also kept as a companion dog because of its easy-going nature and devotion. It is a cheerful, active dog and is always ready to play, responding to any form of attention with a happily wagging tail. Russian Spaniels are trainable, can make a good watchdog, and are amiable with children.The Russian spaniel swims and dives to retrieve wounded birds. It is used for hunting marsh, field and upland game. Previousely the breed was also tested for blood trailing. Russian spaniels possess a good instinct, stamina. They could be used as a watchdog.

The breed has prick ears and a sickle tail carried over the back. Temperament should be non aggressive. Colour can be any of the normal Spitz-type colours, but red and ticking on the legs is undesirable.,This is a lively breed that enjoys time spent in the great outdoors. As a hunter who frequently trees game, the Russo-European Laika uses its voice to alert the hunter to the treed prey (typically a raccoon or squirrel). The Russo-European Laika is also one of the best dogs for duck hunting. It may use its voice freely in the house as well because it is easily excited about things going on around it. The Russo-European Laika has a strong love of family. Once bonded to them, it is quite territorial and makes an excellent guard dog. It is extremely tolerant of children, although not of strangers or other unfamiliar dogs.,Eager to please and with energy to spare, the Russo-European Laika benefits tremendously from training of any kind. Socialization must begin in puppyhood and continue throughout its life.

The offspring were then further crossed with German Shepherds.,Leendert Saarloos (1884\u20131969) was a Dutch zoologist and dog breeder who believed that the German Shepherd had become too domesticated and wanted to breed back the more natural properties in order to derive a better working dog. In 1935, he bred a male working line German Shepherd (German: Deutscher Sch\u00e4ferhund, Dutch: Duitse herdershond) to a female Eurasian grey wolf (Canis lupus lupus) from Siberia. He then bred the offspring back with German Shepherds to derive a dog with one quarter wolf blood. The result was a dog that was not useful as a working dog but as companion that is close to nature. The Dutch Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1975. To honour its creator, they named this dog the \"Saarloos wolfdog\". In 1981, the breed was recognized by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI).,In 2015, a DNA study found that the Saarloos wolfdog showed more genetic association with the grey wolf than any other breed, which is in agreement with the documented historical crossbreeding with grey wolves in this breed. In 2016, a major DNA study of domestic dogs found a deep division between the Saarloos wolfdog and all other dogs, highlighting its descent from the crossing of German Shepherds with captive wolves in the 1930s. In 2019, a genomic study found that the amount of grey wolf ancestry possessed by the Saarloos wolfdog is 18\u201333% and the Czechoslovakian wolfdog 11\u201312%.,The Saarloos wolfdog is a strongly built dog whose build, coat and movement is wolf-like. The height is between 65\u201375 cm (26\u201330 in) in males and 60\u201370 cm (24\u201328 in) in females.  It weighs up to 45 kg (100 lb). It is an athletic dog in build, with medium bone, and a strong and muscular body. It moves lightly on its feet and has an elegant march. Its coat is short and dense, providing good protection from the weather. There are three colours: wolf-grey, red and white. Because the wolf-grey genes are dominant, this is the most common colour.

It has gained a recognition of the Alianza Canina Latina.The breed, which is indigenous to the island, was founded with approximately 170 specimens gathered from rural parts of inner Sardinia. The breed is, therefore, a landrace. Because of the large number of founders and the breed's genetic variability, the breed should enjoy relative freedom from genetic inbreeding. Most of the dog breeds are derived by a very small number of founders (for example, nine dogs were used as founders of the Siberian Husky) and therefore inbreeding tends to be high, resulting in a high incidence of illness due to gene mutations.,The dog has a rough coat, which can be grey, black, brindle, brown or white. Height at the withers is about 56 to 60 cm for males, while females are a couple of centimeters shorter. A typical characteristic of the breed is the fiery expression of the eyes, whose position, unlike other dog breeds, is totally frontal, giving the dog a unique \"monkey-like\" appearance.Variability observed between individuals is likely due to the lack of selective pressures. There are, however, consistently strong commonalities across dogs from different locations, including characteristics such as amber eye color and the characteristic \"monkey-like face\". The coat, irrespective of color, has a typical coarse outer layer, as well as a woolly and dense undercoat. The hair on the head and hindquarters is typically short, while the face has longer furnishings around the eyes and a beard-like length around the muzzle and chin. Male dogs have a longer and thicker coat around the neck forming a mane.Approximately 15% of individuals are short-coated, and this is generally selected against in favor of the long-coated variety. Approximately 30% of individuals have a natural bobtail.,In 2016, a genomic study revealed that Fonni's Dog is associated with sighthound and molossoid breeds from the eastern and southern Mediterranean.

In outward appearance, the Scottish Deerhound is similar to the Greyhound, but larger and more heavily boned with a rough-coat. The Deerhound is closely related to the Irish Wolfhound and was a contributor to that breed when it was re-created at the end of the 19th century.,The Hilton of Cadboll Stone dates from around 1,200 years ago, and depicts at the bottom of the panel a deer that is being chased by two large dogs and two armed horsemen. However, systematic zooarchaeology and genetics have yet to show any connection between those symbolic representations of dog types and the modern breed, which only became widely known as the Scottish Deerhound distinct from regional greyhounds, such as the Highland greyhound or other staghounds in the early 19th century.The deerhound is believed to be descended from old Gaelic hounds, and therefore closely related to the Irish wolfhound.The Deerhound was bred to hunt red deer by coursing and deer-stalking until the end of the 19th century. With modern rifles and smaller deer-forests, slower tracking dogs were preferred to fast and far-running Deerhounds. In coursing deer, a single Deerhound or a pair was brought as close as possible to red deer, then released to run one of them down by speed, which if successful would happen within a few minutes \u2014 rarely were there successful sustained chases.,With the eventual demise of the clan systems in Scotland, these hunting dogs became sporting animals for landowners and the nobility, but were also bred and hunted with by common folk when feasible. As fast and silent hunters they made quick work of any game the size of a hare or larger and were highly regarded by nobility and poachers alike. One of the most precarious times in the breed's history seems to have been towards the end of the nineteenth century, when many of the large Scottish estates were split into small estates for sporting purposes, and few then kept Deerhounds. The new fashion was for stalking and shooting, which required only a tracking dog to follow the wounded animal, using a collie or similar breed. Although a few estates still employed Deerhounds for their original work, the breed was left in the hands of a few enthusiasts who made them a show breed.,Teddy Roosevelt wrote that some Canadian and American hunters used \"the greyhound, whether the smooth-haired, or the rough-coated Scotch deer-hound\" on the wolf and deer Dr. Q van Hummell also remarks on his Deerhound pack being used on timber wolves and coyotes.,In Australia, Deerhounds and their cross-breeds such as the Kangaroo Dog have historically been used to hunt the kangaroo as well as wild boar, modern descriptions of such hunts with Deerhounds on kangaroo and emu have been recorded by Kenneth Cassels.,In outward appearance, the Scottish Deerhound is similar to the Greyhound, but larger and more heavily boned. However, Deerhounds have a number of characteristics that set them apart. While not as fast as a Greyhound on a smooth, firm surface, once the going gets rough or heavy they can outrun a Greyhound. The environment in which they worked, the cool, often wet, and hilly Scottish Highland glens, contributed to the larger, rough-coated appearance of the breed. The Deerhound is closely related to the Irish wolfhound and was a contributor to that breed when it was created at the end of the 19th century.,The Scottish Deerhound resembles a rough-coated greyhound. It is however, larger in size and bone. Minimum desirable height at withers of males is 30 inches (75\u201380 cm) or more, weight 85 to 110 pounds (39 to 50 kg); height of females from 28 inches (71 cm) upwards, weight from 75 to 95 pounds (34 to 43 kg). It is one of the tallest sighthounds, with a harsh 3\u20134-inch (7.6\u201310 cm) long coat and mane, somewhat softer beard and moustache, and softer hair on breast and belly. It has small, dark \"rose\" ears which are soft and folded back against the head unless held semi-erect in excitement. ,The harsh, wiry coat in modern dogs is only seen in self-coloured various shades of gray (blue-gray is preferred). Historically, Deerhounds also could be seen with true brindle, yellow, and red fawn coats, or combinations as recorded in the now oldest & most original breed standard, that of the AKC. 19th century Scottish paintings tend to indicate these colours were associated with a wire haired coat, but, with show breeders preferring a dark, longer coat, these genes now appear to be lost. A white chest and toes are allowed, and a slight white tip to the tail; a white blaze on the head or a white collar are not accepted.

It was designated as a national monument in 1937.,The Shikoku is one of the six native Japanese breeds, it is intermediate in size between the large Akita Inu and the small Shiba Inu; all are within the Spitz family of dogs.A study of the 1930s carried out by the Japanese cynologist Haruo Isogai classified all native Japanese dog breeds into three categories: large-, medium-, and small-sized. The Shikoku belongs to the Shika-inus, the medium-sized dogs. Other medium-sized dogs are the Kai Ken, the Ainu Ken and the Kishu Inu. They are all very similar with overlapping colors and only minor differences in size and morphology.It also served as the partial ancestor to the Tosa after it was crossed with European breeds such as the Great Dane, Old English Bulldog, English Mastiff, St. Bernard (dog) and others.,Shikoku are typically brave but wary, and very alert to their environment. They should be sensitive without being nervous.,Shikoku dogs are tough and sufficiently athletic to run through mountainous terrain. The dog\u2019s overall movement is agile and it should walk with springy steps.,They are an excellent companion for active outdoor people, though they can be very challenging to off-leash train. They are very energetic and active outside but they are generally calm and quiet indoors. The Shikoku is a very intelligent dog and a quick learner. They are not as stubborn and independent as some of the other native Japanese breeds, but still require patience to train.,The Shikoku stands 18.1\u201321.6 inches (46\u201355 cm) tall at the withers and comes in sesame (red with black tipping), black and tan, or red. Sesame coats are found in a range of saturation and black pigment- typically designated as red sesame, sesame, or black sesame. In addition, there is a cream colored coat that is rarely seen as it is not an accepted color in the breed. In all of these colors there is usually a mixture of white found around the underside of the body, near the eyes, snout, and legs called \"urajiro\".  The Shikoku tends to shed its coat at least one to two times a year. The dog has a fairly thick coat with pointed ears and a curved tail. The body conformation is typically of the spitz-type: the square body, the wedge-shaped head, the prick triangular ears, and thick curled tail.,The Shikoku dog is somewhat unusual in its appearance. It looks similar to a Siberian Husky dog physically, but differs in its size and color. The Shikoku Inu ranges 14\u201323 kg (31\u201351 lb) (male; approximately 20 inches tall; female; approximately 18.5 inches tall).

The breed belongs to the Spitz genetic family. It is recognizable by its thickly furred double coat, erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings, and is smaller than the similar-looking Alaskan Malamute.,Siberian Huskies originated in Northeast Asia where they are bred by the Chukchi people of Siberia for sled pulling, and companionship. It is an active, energetic, resilient breed, whose ancestors lived in the extremely cold and harsh environment of the Siberian Arctic. William Goosak, a Russian fur trader, introduced them to Nome, Alaska, during the Nome Gold Rush, initially as sled dogs to work the mining fields and for expeditions through otherwise impassable terrain. Today, the Siberian Husky is typically kept as a house pet, though they are still frequently used as sled dogs by competitive and recreational mushers.,The Siberian Husky was originally developed by the Chukchi people of the Chukchi Peninsula in eastern Siberia. They were brought to Nome, Alaska in 1908 to serve as working sled dogs, and were eventually developed and used for sled dog racing. In 2015, a DNA study indicated that the Siberian Husky, the Alaskan Malamute and the Alaskan husky share a close genetic relationship between each other and were related to Chukotka sled dogs from Siberia. They were separate to the two Inuit dogs, the Canadian Eskimo Dog and the Greenland Dog. In North America, the Siberian Husky and the Malamute both had maintained their Siberian lineage and had contributed significantly to the Alaskan husky, which was developed through crossing with European breeds. Siberian Huskies show an genetic affinity with historical East Siberian dogs and ancient Lake Baikal dogs, and can be traced to a lineage which is over 9,500 years old.Several Arctic dog breeds, including the Siberian, show a significant genetic closeness with the now-extinct Taimyr wolf of North Asia due to admixture. These breeds are associated with high latitudes \u2013 the Siberian Husky and Greenland Dog, also associated with arctic human populations and to a lesser extent, the Shar-Pei and Finnish Spitz. There is data to indicate admixture of between 1\u20133% between the Taymyr wolf population and the ancestral dog population of these four high-latitude breeds. This introgression could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment. It also indicates the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than one region.,A Siberian Husky has a double coat that is thicker than that of most other dog breeds. It has two layers: a dense, finely wavy undercoat and a longer topcoat of thicker, straight guard hairs. It protects the dogs effectively against harsh Arctic winters, and also reflects heat in the summer. It is able to withstand temperatures as low as \u221250 to \u221260 \u00b0C (\u221258 to \u221276 \u00b0F). The undercoat is often absent during shedding. Their thick coats require weekly grooming. An excessively long coat, sometimes referred to as a \"wooly\" or \"woolie\" coat, is considered a fault by the breed's standard as it lacks the thicker protection of the standard coat's guard hairs, obscures the dog's clear-cut outline, causes quicker overheating during serious harness work, and becomes easily matted and encrusted with snow and ice. Siberian Huskies come in a variety of colors and patterns, often with white paws and legs, facial markings, and tail tip. Example coat colors are black and white, copper-red and white, grey and white, pure white, and the rare \"agouti\" coat, though many individuals have blondish or piebald spotting. Some other individuals also have the \"saddle back\" pattern, in which black-tipped guard hairs are restricted to the saddle area while the head, haunches and shoulders are either light red or white. Striking masks, spectacles, and other facial markings occur in wide variety. All coat colors from black to pure white are allowed. Merle coat patterns are not permitted by the American Kennel Club (AKC) and The Kennel Club (KC). This pattern is often associated with health issues and impure breeding." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c54e" }, "breed": "Slovakian Wirehaired Pointer", "origin": "Slovakia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak_Rough-haired_Pointer", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/ICh_Brita_z_Ruzenice.jpg/220px-ICh_Brita_z_Ruzenice.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6dd" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/slovakian_wirehaired_pointer.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 4, "shedding": 2, "grooming": 1, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 5, "energy": 4, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 15, "max_height_male": 26.5, "max_height_female": 26.5, "max_weight_male": 65, "max_weight_female": 65, "min_height_male": 24.5, "min_height_female": 24.5, "min_weight_male": 50, "min_weight_female": 50, "breed": "Slovakian Wirehaired Pointer" }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c703" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/slovakian_wirehaired_pointer.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 4, "shedding": 2, "grooming": 1, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 5, "energy": 4, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 15, "max_height_male": 26.5, "max_height_female": 26.5, "max_weight_male": 65, "max_weight_female": 65, "min_height_male": 24.5, "min_height_female": 24.5, "min_weight_male": 50, "min_weight_female": 50, "breed": "Slovakian Wirehaired Pointer" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fb7" }, "breed": "Slovakian Wirehaired Pointer", "contenido": "The Slovak Rough-haired Pointer is a gundog breed developed after World War II in Slovakia.

This breed\u2014also known as Slovensky Cuvac, Slovak Chuvach, Tatransky Cuvac and Slovensky Kuvac\u2014is closely related to the Hungarian Kuvasz. The alternate German and English spelling Tchouvatch reflects the pronunciation: chew-votch( \u010duvati - in serbocroatian language  - guarding) . The breed is recognised under sponsorship from Slovakia by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale with the name Slovensk\u00fd \u010duva\u010d. Despite the multiple renderings in English, these refer to only one breed. The United Kennel Club in the US uses the English version of the name Slovak Cuvac.,A good watchdog, guard, shepherd and companion, the dog proved itself also in watching cattle, turkeys, and other domestic animals - as well as its master's household. Holiday makers and visitors to the mountains and spas took to this breed and began to carry it to the lowlands. The Slovensky Cuvac is used on sheep farms and mountain ridges as well as homes and frontiers. He is boundlessly loyal and stout hearted. He resists every enemy - bears and wolves included. According to the time honored shepherd's tradition, he is always bred in white to be discernible from the beasts of the night.,This breed has been well documented as far back as the 17th century. However, as wolves slowly began to disappear from European mountains and modern herding practices were instituted, the Cuvac was faced with the prospect of being seen as a relic of the past. What few specimens were left in the 1950s were bred carelessly. Credit for reviving the breed and fixing characteristics is due Dr. Antonin Hruza, in cooperation with the veterinary school of Brno.,The registered breeding of the Slovensky Cuvac was established in Czechoslovakia by Professor Antonin Hruza from the Veterinary Faculty in Brno on June 4, 1929. The Club of the Breeders of Slovak Cuvac was established in 1933 and a written standard was established and approved in 1964 Dr. V. Kurz). The basic breeding material came from the vicinity of Liptovska Luzna, Kokava and Vychodna as well as from Rachov in the Carpathians.,The body of Slovak Cuvac is slightly longer than higher. Strong and straight ridge goes - way to lower back - a little bit sloped. Strong square butt is slightly sloped, too. The low-placed tail is worn hanging, reaching hock joints. Chest reaching to elbow joint and chest's width can compared to circa one quarter of scapula's height. Ribs are well rounded and achieving long back. Belly and flanks are slightly pulled. Long scapulas are slant laid. The Slovak Cuvac has straight legs placed vertically to his body and well angled. The front paws are compact, rounded. The back paws are a little bit longer. The neck is as long as head.,The wide and elongated skull is a little bit arched, but the top of the head is flat. With side view are straight line of top of the head and straight line of nose's ridge parallel. The stop is well apparent. The supra-orbital arcs are marked, the frontal groove is flat. The wide and heavy mouth is slightly narrowed to top of the nose and is a little bit shorter than the skull. The lips fit tightly. The ears are placed high, reclined and fitted tightly to the head. The ear points are rounded. The eyes are oval shaped with caps fitting closely, straight placed at the head. The Cuvac has scissors occlusion.,The fur is dense and rich, centre parting at the ridge is not allowed. Covering hair, which is constituted by hair with 5\u201315 cm length, completely covers the shorter, dense and soft undercoat. Male dogs have collar around the neck. The fur is pure white. A yellowish tinge by ears is permissible, but not desirable. The eyes are brown. Muzzle, lips edges and eyelids, like the paw pads, are black." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c551" }, "breed": "Smalandst\u00f6vare", "origin": "Sweden", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smaland_Hound", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Smaland-St%C3%B6vare.jpg/220px-Smaland-St%C3%B6vare.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fba" }, "breed": "Smalandst\u00f6vare", "contenido": "Smaland Hound (Swedish: Sm\u00e5landsst\u00f6vare) is a breed of dog that originated in Sweden in the 16th century. Thought to be the oldest scent hound breed native to Sweden, it was first recognized by the Swedish Kennel Club in 1921. They are the smallest of the Swedish hound breeds, and have black and tan markings similar to the rottweiler. Internationally, it is recognized by a number of kennel clubs and registries including the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale and United Kennel Club. It is considered rare, even in its native Sweden where only around sixty puppies are registered each year.,The breed has existed in Sweden since the 16th century. The name originated from the breed's links with Sm\u00e5land in southern Sweden. During the time of the Swedish Empire a number of wars were fought, with soldiers returning to their native country bringing a variety of hound breeds with them. These hounds were bred with local spitz type dogs, and the offspring became the foundation stock of the modern Sm\u00e5landsst\u00f6vare.Farmers in Sweden preferred an all around hunting dog as they could often only afford to feed a single hunting dog, and so the breed became adept at hunting a number of quarry including hares, squirrels and foxes as well as birds and larger game such as moose. During this initial period the Sm\u00e5landsst\u00f6vare came in a variety of colors, sizes and lengths of tail with selective breeding not being put into practice until the 19th century. At the first dog show held in Sweden, in 1889, 444 dogs were entered, of which 189 were hound type dogs, including a number of Sm\u00e5landsst\u00f6vares. In the early 20th century, breeders worked to restore the breed to the old type, with a naturally occurring short tail.The breed was first recognized by the Swedish Kennel Club in 1921, the same year that the first breed standard was drawn up. The first of the breed to be registered was Skoj av Myren 789 V, owned by Mary Stephens from the Torne valley. At the time of the first standard, both long and short tails were allowed under the regulations. Baron Frederik von Essen is responsible for breeding short tailed Sm\u00e5landsst\u00f6vares, which was to become a trait of the entire breed after they were initially developed in J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping County. The most recent standard was drawn up in 1952, around the same time as other dogs of a similar type were used to inject new blood into the breed. This was the most recent time that dogs with an unknown background were allowed to be registered as a Sm\u00e5landsst\u00f6vare. Currently on average around sixty puppies a year are registered with the Swedish Kennel Club, and the breed is therefore considered rare. They are not normally seen outside of Sweden.Outside of Sweden, it is recognized by the American Rare Breed Association, Continental Kennel Club, and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale. The United Kennel Club recognized the breed as the Smaland Hound in 2006.,Often confused with the Rottweiler breed due to common coat coloring, the Sm\u00e5landsst\u00f6vare is the oldest scent hound breed native to Sweden. They have a medium length top coat with a shorter, dense undercoat; longer hair grows on the fringed tail and thighs. The most common coloring of the breed is a mostly black coat with tan markings, although the markings can range in color from shades of amber to a reddish brown.They have a tough, robust body which is compact and almost square in shape. It is the smallest of the Swedish hounds, on average they measure between 16\u201321 inches (41\u201353 cm) at the withers with males being slightly larger than females. Average weight is around 33\u201344 pounds (15\u201320 kg) for both genders. The Sm\u00e5landsst\u00f6vare has a natural bobtail due to this being specifically bred into the breed, and a typical member of the breed should be well muscled in proportion throughout.The facial features include wide nostrils on a black nose, the jaw closes in a scissors bite and the eyes are typically dark brown. The skull itself is lean with a well defined stop. The ears have rounded tips, and are set fairly high on the skull, hanging flat down the sides.,A popular Swedish hunting dog, members of the breed can form strong attachments to their master; but are also seen as household pets due to their gentle and protective nature. In hunting, they are used to drive the quarry for the hunter. They are a highly intelligent breed, and require a high level of exercise. They therefore are not best suited to living in a small apartment. Sm\u00e5landsst\u00f6vare are wary of strangers and can be territorial, but this can also make a Sm\u00e5landsst\u00f6vare a good watchdog. Participation in field trials for Sm\u00e5landsst\u00f6vares are becoming increasingly common. They remain active up until around twelve years old." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c559" }, "breed": "Sporting Lucas Terrier", "origin": "Scotland", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_Lucas_Terrier", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/LucasTerrier.jpg/220px-LucasTerrier.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fc5" }, "breed": "Sporting Lucas Terrier", "contenido": "The Sporting Lucas Terrier is a small breed of dog of the terrier type.

In 1999 the Lucas Terrier Club de-listed all of Brian Plummer's dogs as they \"did not want infusions of other terrier types introduced into their bloodlines\".

Today it has returned to being primarily a pet and showdog.Another breed of terrier developed by Brian Plummer is the Plummer Terrier. It is similar, but bull terrier was also used, and the dog developed a reputation for quarrelsomeness.,Of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world, only the United Kennel Club (US) recognises the Sporting Lucas Terrier, in their Terrier Group.

Coat colours are red and fawn; a white mark on the chest may be present. The breed tolerates extremes of temperature well, and has remained a healthy breed through \"refresher breeding\" (Auffrischungszucht, outcrossing).,The breed was created in the 1870s by Karl Peintinger, an industrialist from Styria. Peintinger crossed his \"Hela 1\", from an old type of Hanoverian scent hound, with an Istrian Hound, and continued selective breeding until a rough-coated, hardy hunting dog was achieved. The breed is used by Austrians and Slovenians to hunt wild boar. It can also be used to track wounded animals through rough terrain and in high altitudes.,As with many breeds bred for work, they are not generally kept as a companion dog and do not make good pets; they require a lot of space and exercise, and can be dominant and destructive.,The Styrian Coarse-haired Hound is sometimes called the Peintinger Bracke after the creator of the breed in the 1870s. The breed was first recognised in 1889. It is recognised in its home country by the \u00d6sterreichische Kynologenverband (Austrian Kennel Club) and internationally by the  F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale as a medium-sized scenthound, breed number 62.

It is a low, compact spaniel and is as old a breed as and similar in appearance to the Clumber Spaniel. They can be slow-paced, but can have a clownish and energetic temperament. They suffer from health conditions common to spaniels and some large dogs, as well as a specific range of heart conditions and spinal disc herniation.,The Sussex Spaniel was first recorded in 1795 in East and West Sussex, being at Goodwood and Rolvenden for specific hunting conditions. The breed nearly became extinct during the Second World War, but was bred back to sustainable numbers. It is now more popular in the United Kingdom and the United States than any other countries, and is recognised by all major kennel clubs. The breed was one of the first to be recognised by the UK Kennel Club in 1872. Sussex Spaniel Stump won the best in show in 2009 at the 133rd Westminster Kennel Club.,The Sussex Spaniel is a low compact spaniel similar in appearance, but not in colour, to a  Clumber Spaniel. It is normally no taller than 15\u201316 in (38\u201341 cm) at the withers and the usual weight range is 45\u201350 lb (20\u201323 kg) with a roughly rectangular appearance. The Clumber Spaniel meanwhile is normally between 17\u201320 in (43\u201351 cm) high at the shoulder, and weighing 55\u201385 lb (25\u201339 kg).One of the noticeable features is their golden liver-coloured coat which is unique to the breed. Historically however, there have also been examples of black, black and tan and golden liver and white coloured Sussex Spaniels.  coat is thick (sometimes with a slight wave to it), feathering on the chest, legs and ears and consists of a weather-resistant undercoat with a silky outer coat. The eyes are hazel in colour. The long silky ears are lobe-shaped typical of the Spaniel, and set moderately low. The Sussex is a short, stocky kind of dog.,The Sussex Spaniel is a slow-paced, calm breed with somewhat clownish behaviour that normally keeps his energy and enthusiasm in check.  He is always eager to be around people, is excellent around children, and can be quite protective of the family. They make excellent candidates for therapy dog work.  Most Sussex Spaniels are primarily family pets, but they are competent enough to aid a hunter though quite stubborn to train. They tend to have a natural ability to quarter in the field, have excellent noses, and can be used to retrieve, given training.

It is lower-set, with shorter legs, and is more muscular with heavier bone density than the related American Rat Terrier. Much diversity exists in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed, and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha, and Tenterfield Terrier. The Rat Terrier's background is said to stem from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working-class immigrants. Since the breed was a farm, hunting, and utility dog, little to no planned breeding was used  other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other to produce the desired work ethic in the dog. The Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit Dog, and Wry-legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry.  These early ratting terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle crossbred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs. Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell. and a very high intellect. Although they tend to be aloof with strangers, they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners at all times.,The current UKC standard calls for a Teddy Roosevelt Terrier to be 8\u201315 in (20\u201338 cm) in height, with weight proportionate to height. Teddy Roosevelt Terriers weighing as much as 25 lb (11 kg) or as little as 8 lb (3.6 kg) are not uncommon.,Early American history shows that the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier, like the Rat Terrier, were often referred to as Feist or just plain terrier mixes - in the case of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier, \"bench-legged feist\".Since the breed was primarily a farm and hunting dog, crossing Rat Terriers to other breeds was common. One such early cross was with the Beagle, and  this cross possibly reinforced the bench leg, since the Bench-legged Beagle was a common hunting companion.Separating the long-legged phenotype from the short-legged phenotype in most cases did not occur, litters born from parents of either or both phenotypes commonly displayed a variety of leg and body length, yet all were still considered and labeled merely as Rat Terriers. In the middle 1990s, efforts to segregate the types began in earnest, but mixing of the two types in some cases still exists today.,When the types were separated by the Rat Terrier Club of America, the short-legged variety was named in honor of Theodore Roosevelt, although he never owned Rat Terriers nor was he instrumental in developing the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier. The dog most attributed to being one of the foundations for the Rat Terriers was a black-and-tan, mixed-breed, feist-type dog owned by the Roosevelts. In one of his letters to his children, President Roosevelt writes, \"There is a very cunning little dog named Skip, belonging to John Goff's pack, who has completely adopted me. I think I shall take him home to Archie. He likes to ride on Dr. Lambert's horse, or mine, and though he is not as big as Jack, takes eager part in the fight with every bear and bobcat.\" Often confused with Skip the black and tan feist, the Roosevelts also had a dog named Scamp. Scamp is the only dog mentioned in Roosevelt's letters as ever hunting rats while in the White House, \"Scamp is really an extraordinary ratter and kills a great many rats in the White House, in the cellars and on the lower floor and among the machinery. He is really a very nice little dog.\" Unfortunately, no pictures of Scamp nor descriptions other than one which describes him as a Fox Terrier have been found. Another terrier which often is confused with the Rat Terrier was Roosevelt's dog named Jack. In Mr. Roosevelt's letter dated July 27, 1902, to Mrs. Roswell Field, he writes, \"It is a real pleasure to send you a photograph of my boy Kermit, with Jack, the Manchester Terrier, who is absolutely a member of the family.\"  Jack was a Manchester Terrier, not a Rat Terrier.,The first standard for the breed was developed by the now-defunct Teddy Roosevelt Terrier Club of America in 1996. Currently, several registration organizations are active, all of which have their own standards, but the most commonly accepted are the United Kennel Club  and the United Kennel Club International, although the UKCI still only recognizes them as a variation of the Rat Terrier.,In 1999, both \"Rat Terrier\" and \u201cTeddy Roosevelt Terrier\" were accepted as a separate breeds by the United Kennel Club.Currently, the UKC accepts single Teddy Roosevelt Terrier registration applications for dogs from 10 different registries, where they are simply designated as Rat Terriers. [1].,The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a low-set, muscular, active, small- to medium-sized hunting terrier. The preferred ratio of length of body (prosternum to point of buttocks) to height (withers to ground) is between 10:7 and 10:8. The head is broad, slightly domed, wedge-shaped, and proportionate to the size of the body. Ears are V-shaped, set at the outside edges of the skull, and may be erect or button. A docked tail is preferred, but a natural bob tail or a natural tail carried in an upward curve is also acceptable. The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier occurs in solid white, other solid colors with markings, and white with a variety of colored patches." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c569" }, "breed": "Terrier Brasileiro", "origin": "Brazil", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Terrier", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Terrier_brazylijski_2.jpg/220px-Terrier_brazylijski_2.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fda" }, "breed": "Terrier Brasileiro", "contenido": "The Brazilian Terrier is a breed of dog developed in Brazil.

The name comes from the local word for a sheep pen, \"tor\". The foundation stock is made up from genetically homogeneous landrace shepherding dogs dispersed in the mountains and valleys of the region. They are a molosser-type mountain dog, similar to other livestock guardian breeds of the region, the \u0160arplaninac, Bucovina Shepherd Dog, and the Greek Shepherd.,Tornjak belongs to the rare livestock protection breeds and shares many characteristics with other livestock guarding dogs. The Tornjak is an old breed first mentioned in the 11th then 14th century. Descriptions of the Tornjak were found in the writings of Peter Horvat, bishop of \u0110akovo, Croatia, which date back to the year 1374, those descriptions were also found in the writings of Peter Luki\u0107, Canon of the \u0110akovo diocese, which were written in 1752. To this day, these dogs are called Tora\u0161i (Torashi) in the surroundings of the city of Sinj and on the Kame\u0161nica mountain, whereas the shepherds of the Dinara-mountains call them Dinarci. Descriptions of Tornjaks from these documents are the very same as they are today, except for the name of the breed, which was Bosanski Ov\u010dar, meaning Bosnian Shepherd Dog. It was also called the Hrvatski pas planinac, meaning Croatian mountain dog. The dogs in these documents were described entirely equal (in respect to their function and their appearance) as they are today: a protective guarding dog which keeps and watches all that their owners ask them, but is highly intelligent and selectively bred to be without excessive aggression. They are also pleasant toward strangers that they meet outside of their domain.,It is considered that the dogs of the Tornjak's type have existed in the area around and in Dinarides (Dinaric Alps), especially in the region around Vla\u0161i\u0107 (close to the city of Travnik, Bosnia and Herzegovina) as a central area of the region since the Roman times. The Romans used their dogs for war and as guardian dogs, as well as for fighting in the arena. Although the Tornjak is a very old breed, with the vanishing of nomadic sheep herding, the Tornjak also gradually vanished. In the early 1970s, a group of local cynologists began to collect the remaining dogs which best corresponded to the old writings about the breed. Tornjaks were first imported to the UK in 2013 with intentions of working towards UK Kennel Club Recognition.,The Tornjak is a large and powerful dog, with well proportioned, almost square-bodied features and agile movements. The dog's bones are not light, but nevertheless not heavy nor coarse. The bodies of these dogs are strong and well built, with harmonious and dignified movements, possessing a self-confident, serious and calm disposition. In general the Tornjak is a long-coated dog with short hair over the face and legs. The hair is distinctively long and abundant over the neck (mane), and on the back of the upper thighs (breeches). The tail is especially well feathered, and carried like a flag while the dog moves. The coat is very dense and can not be parted.,As a rule, the Tornjak is parti-colored, with white being the dominant ground color. White markings are most commonly found around the neck, over the head and along the legs. The patches can be any color. Similar to other livestock guardian dogs, the distinct markings served an utilitarian purpose, helping shepherds distinguish their dogs from both sheep and wolves." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c572" }, "breed": "Toy Manchester Terrier", "origin": "United States", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Manchester_Terrier", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Toy-manchester-terrier-weave.png/220px-Toy-manchester-terrier-weave.png", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fe6" }, "breed": "Toy Manchester Terrier", "contenido": "The Toy Manchester Terrier is a breed of dog, categorized as a terrier.

In England, another breed was also developed in the 19th century in Manchester, the English Toy Terrier, as a separate breed from the Manchester Terrier. The English Toy Terrier was a popular pet in Victorian England, and bred to be very small, some weighing as little as 1 kg (2.2 lbs.)The Toy Manchester Terrier breed was developed by breeding down the Manchester Terrier in size. In the United States in the 1920s the breed was called the Toy Black and Tan Terrier. The name was changed to the Toy Manchester Terrier and the American Toy Manchester Terrier Club was formed in the 1930s. The American Toy Manchester Terrier was recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1938, but by the 1950s the breed had declined and the breed club ceased to exist. Due to declining numbers of the breed, the Toy Manchester Terrier breed was re-defined as a size division of the Manchester Terrier in 1958 by the American Kennel Club, and the club name (including the two breeds as varieties) was changed to the American Manchester Terrier Club in 1958.In England, the very similar English Toy Terrier (Black & Tan) has also declined, to the point where it is listed by the Kennel Club as being in danger of extinction. In order to rescue the breed, the Kennel Club has opened the stud book to allow certain selected examples of the North American Toy Manchester Terrier to be registered and bred as an English Toy Terrier (Black & Tan). However, the two breeds are not considered to be identical, and the standards for the two breeds show different requirements.,The Toy Manchester Terrier in North America is a small, long-legged dog with a short coat   marked with tan, a long tail and ears which stand upright.

However, the Toy Manchester Terrier cannot exceed 12 pounds (5.4 kg) in weight; and, unlike the larger Manchester Terrier, for the Toy Manchester Terrier, cropped ears are a disqualification. Ears should be wide at the base and pointed at the tip.

It is a strong, medium-sized scent hound, characterized by a black body, with tan and sometimes white markings on the muzzle, chest and extremities, and distinctive tan eyebrow spots. It has a high-pitched bark for a dog of its size. The breed was rescued from extinction by focused breeding efforts in the late 20th century. There were formerly two varieties, the tall and the short, developed for different kinds of hunting in the Middle Ages. Only the tall variety survives today.,It is claimed the Transylvanian Hound descends from hounds brought by the Magyars when they crossed the Carpathian Mountains in the 9th century, these hounds were bred with those already found in the area with the resultant progeny becoming the foundation stock for the breed. The dog was the favourite of the Hungarian aristocracy during the breed's peak in the Middle Ages, for hunting various game animals Two height varieties developed to hunt different game in different types of terrain, and both varieties were kept together. ,The tall variety was used for hunting woodland and grassland big game, such as European bison, bear, boar, and lynx. The short variety was used for hunting fox, hare, and chamois in overgrown or rocky terrain.,The breed declined, and was marginalised to the Carpathian woodlands, shrinking with the growth of agriculture and forestry, and by the beginning of the twentieth century the breed was nearly extinct. The breed was almost wiped out during World War II, and in 1947, after Transylvania became fully part of Romania again, the Romanian government exterminated those that had survived in to remove the reminder of the Hungarian \"occupation\". Some survived in Hungary and Slovakia, where breeders are working to revive the breed.Saving and embracing the breed starts three times:- In 1886, the first official registration of the breed began with the \"Hungarian Hunting Dog Pedigree\" (Magyar Vad\u00e1szeb T\u00f6rzsk\u00f6nyv).- In 1941 the breed was registered as a Hungarian Hound by the Hungarian National Vizsla Club/Hound Division (Magyar Orsz\u00e1gos Vizsla Klub/Kop\u00f3 szakoszt\u00e1ly) and it started the rescue of the breed with 27 individuals. Unfortunately, World War II shattered further plans. The next rescue operation was possible in the 1960s.,- 1966. As a result of the research work of  dr. Csaba Anghi, dr. \u00c1kos Szederjei, dr. Lajos Gy\u0151rffy, Andor Standeisky, dr. Tam\u00e1s Fodor, Imre Bogd\u00e1n, dr. Atilla Kelemen and G\u00e9za B\u00f3ka it was possible to find purebred specimens in Transylvania. These specimens were included in the breeding process in Hungary. As a result of many years of work and research, the standard was completed in 1966 and then registered by the FCI as the Hungarian Hound-Transylvanian Scenthound. The breed was not recognised and standardised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) until 1963. In 1968, efforts began to save it.  Today, a substantial number of the tall variety of the dogs may be found in both Hungary and neighboring Romania. ,The Transylvanian Hound is, naturally, recognised by the national dog breeding and fancier group, the Hungarian Kennel Club (using the FCI breed standard)." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c57f" }, "breed": "Welsh Sheepdog", "origin": "Wales", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Sheepdog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Welsh_Sheepdog.jpg/220px-Welsh_Sheepdog.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ff8" }, "breed": "Welsh Sheepdog", "contenido": "The Welsh Sheepdog (Welsh: Ci Defaid Cymreig, pronounced [ki\u02d0 \u02c8d\u025bva\u026ad k\u0259m\u02c8r\u025b\u0268\u0261]) is a Welsh breed of herding dog of medium size from Wales. ,Like other types of working dog, Welsh Sheepdogs are normally bred for their herding abilities rather than appearance, and so they are generally somewhat variable in build, colour and size.  Welsh Sheepdogs are of collie type, usually black-and-white, red-and-white or tricolour, and merle markings may occur over any of these combinations.  The coat may be short or fairly long, and the ears are pricked, but usually folded at the tip.  They are longer in leg, broader in chest and wider in muzzle than the Border Collie. They are extremely active and intelligent, and therefore need much exercise and mental stimulation, if they are to be kept as pets.,Over many decades the Welsh Sheepdog has largely been replaced for working sheep in Wales by the Border Collie, a standardised breed. However, in more recent years, efforts have been made to maintain the indigenous Welsh Sheepdog as a distinct variety.,Welsh Sheepdogs are usually of loose-eyed action, not fixing the stock with their gaze like the strong-eyed Border Collie.  They are able to work independently without necessarily being under direct human control.  Welsh Sheepdogs are most often used for herding sheep, but also readily work cattle, goats, and even horses and pigs.  Traditionally they were often used as droving dogs to take cattle and sheep to markets locally or elsewhere in Britain.,The Welsh Sheepdog's life span is 12\u201315 years.,At one time there existed many sheep-herding dogs peculiar to Wales; during the 18th century Welsh drovers taking sheep for sale took with them five or six sheepdogs as \"herders on the narrow roads, guards against highwaymen, and providers of game on the route\". These were an early type of Welsh Sheepdog, higher on the leg and more racily built than the modern day breed.However, by the 1940s the group had decreased to two or three breeds only. The ancient pure breeds of Black-and-Tan Sheepdog and Welsh Hillman were almost extinct, and were scarcely seen working.  The type best known in Wales at that time was mostly descended from the old Black-and-Tan with an infusion of working Border Collie blood.In the 1940s the Welsh Sheepdog was still common throughout the north and central Welsh counties.  In herding activities, it did not normally work low to the ground in \"the showy manner sometimes seen in the work of the working [Border] Collies\", as British dog fancier C. L. B. Hubbard put it in 1948. It was variable in type; approximately 18 in (46 cm) in height, but the weight ranged from the lighter built, leggier dog of North Wales at 35 lb (16 kg) to the more solid 40 to 45 lb (18 to 20 kg) dogs of Glamorganshire and Monmouthshire.  There were no dog show classes for the Welsh Sheepdog as it was purely a working breed.,Welsh Sheepdogs are primarily herding dogs who have a natural ability with large flocks of sheep or cattle.  Some have been trained to compete in dog agility trials, obedience, rally obedience, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Welsh Sheepdogs can be trained to compete in stock dog trials." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c580" }, "breed": "Welsh Springer Spaniel", "origin": "Wales", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Springer_Spaniel", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Welsh_Springer_Spaniel_1.jpg/220px-Welsh_Springer_Spaniel_1.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c71b" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/welsh_springer_spaniel.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 4, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 1, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 5, "energy": 4, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 15, "max_height_male": 19, "max_height_female": 19, "max_weight_male": 55, "max_weight_female": 50, "min_height_male": 18, "min_height_female": 18, "min_weight_male": 40, "min_weight_female": 35, "breed": "Welsh Springer Spaniel" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ff9" }, "breed": "Welsh Springer Spaniel", "contenido": "The Welsh Springer Spaniel (Welsh: Llamgi Cymru) is a breed of dog and a member of the spaniel family. Thought to be comparable to the old Land Spaniel, they are similar to the English Springer Spaniel and historically have been referred to as both the Welsh Spaniel and the Welsh Cocker Spaniel. They were relatively unknown until a succession of victories in dog trials by the breed increased its popularity. Following recognition by The Kennel Club in 1902, the breed gained the modern name of Welsh Springer Spaniel. The breed's coat only comes in a single colour combination of white with red markings, usually in a piebald pattern. Loyal and affectionate, they can become very attached to family members and are wary of strangers. Health conditions are limited to those common among many breeds of dog, although they are affected more than average by hip dysplasia and some eye conditions. They are a working dog, bred for hunting, and while not as rare as some varieties of spaniel, they are rarer than the more widely known English Springer Spaniel with which they are sometimes confused.,The origin of the Welsh Springer Spaniel is unknown, however dogs resembling the breed with its distinctive red and white coat are frequently depicted in old pictures and prints. This type of dog was known as the Land Spaniel, and is considered to be similar to the modern Welsh Springer. John Caius, writing in 1570, said \"Spaniels whose skynnes are white and if marked with any spottes they are commonly red\". It is thought that these Spaniels may have made their way into the Welsh valleys where local sportsman and hunters managed to conserve them in a pure state.At one time called the Welsh Starter, it was used to spring game, originally for hunters using falcons. The traditional red and white colour of the Welsh Springer was once also found in English dogs, but by the early 20th century any such dogs were considered to have \"died out long ago\".The Welsh Springer Spaniel was also at one time called the Welsh Spaniel, and also at one point was included in the Kennel Club (UK) studbook as Cocker Spaniels, and was known as the Welsh Cocker. During the 19th century were several different varieties of Cocker Spaniel, including the English, the Welsh and the Devonshire as the term was used to describe the size of the dog rather than the breed. Unusually, in John George Wood's 1865 book The Illustrated Natural History, an image is described showing a Welsh Cocker Spaniel as a solid coloured dark spaniel. The same inscription is used in the 1867 work The Dog in Health and Disease by Stonehenge and he further describes the Welsh Cocker and the Devonshire Cocker as \"both being of a deep-liver colour\". The Welsh Springer was relatively unknown during the 19th Century, but this changed in 1900 when Mr. A. T. Williams of Ynis-y-Gerwn won the team stake at the Sporting Spaniel Club Trials. The trials were held on Mr. Williams' own estate, and it was thought that when his team defeated eight well known teams it was because of the home advantage. This was disproved when dogs from the same kennel went on to win in successive years around the UK. His conformation show champion dog Corrin was the first Welsh Springer Spaniel to be photographed.,Welsh Springers were recognised by The Kennel Club, after the breed had gained popularity, in 1902 under the new name of Welsh Springer Spaniel. Until then the breed was shown alongside the English Springer Spaniel. The Welsh Springer Spaniel was transported to America in the late 19th century and gained recognition by the American Kennel Club in 1906.World War I caused problems for the breed in the United Kingdom, and when the war was over there were no dogs whose parents had registered pedigrees. The breed restarted with the remaining unregistered dogs, and it is these dogs that formed the modern day breed. The breeders in the 1920s and 1930s developed these dogs into the type of Welsh Springer Spaniel which remains today. The Welsh Springer Spaniel Club (UK) was formed in 1923, registrations slowly increased between the wars but all records held by the breed club were destroyed in an air raid during World War II. Following the two World Wars, it was thought that no Welsh Springers remained in the United States. The breed was reintroduced, and the descendants of those dogs make up the breed today in the United States and Canada. The breed was officially imported into Australia in 1973.In 2000, The Kennel Club registered 424 Welsh Springer Spaniels, compared with 12,599 English Springer Spaniels and 13,445 English Cocker Spaniels. Numbers remained steady, with 420 Welsh Springer Spaniels being registered in 2004, however numbers of English Springer Spaniels increased to 14,765 and English Cocker Spaniels to 16,608. Numbers remain closer to the American Cocker Spaniel which registered 610 in 2000, and 599 in 2004. The breed remains more popular than some other breeds of Spaniel, including the Clumber Spaniel, Field Spaniel, Sussex Spaniel and Irish Water Spaniel. Total registrations in the UK during 2016 fell to 299 qualifying it to be included on The Kennel Club's list of Vulnerable Native Breeds." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c582" }, "breed": "West Highland White Terrier", "origin": "Scotland", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Highland_White_Terrier", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/West_Highland_White_Terrier_Krakow.jpg/220px-West_Highland_White_Terrier_Krakow.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c71c" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/west_highland_white_terrier.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 3, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 4, "playfulness": 5, "protectiveness": 5, "trainability": 3, "energy": 4, "barking": 5, "min_life_expectancy": 13, "max_life_expectancy": 15, "max_height_male": 11, "max_height_female": 11, "max_weight_male": 20, "max_weight_female": 20, "min_height_male": 11, "min_height_female": 11, "min_weight_male": 15, "min_weight_female": 15, "breed": "West Highland White Terrier" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ffc" }, "breed": "West Highland White Terrier", "contenido": "The West Highland White Terrier, commonly known as the Westie, is a breed of dog from Scotland with a distinctive white harsh coat with a somewhat soft white undercoat. It is a medium-sized terrier, although with longer legs than other Scottish breeds of terrier. It has a white double coat of fur which fills out the dog's face, giving it a rounded appearance.,The breed is intelligent, quick to learn, and can be good with children, but does not always tolerate rough handling. The Westie is an active breed, and is social with a high prey drive, as they were once used to hunt rodents.,The modern breed is descended from a number of breeding programmes of white terriers in Scotland before the 20th century. Cousin to the Cairn Terrier, the Westie was bred to hunt small rodents at places such as farms. Edward Donald Malcolm, 16th Laird of Poltalloch, is credited with the creation of the modern breed from his Poltalloch Terrier, but did not want to be known as such.,Other related breeds included George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll's Roseneath Terrier and Dr Americ Edwin Flaxman's Pittenweem Terriers. This breed of small white Scottish terriers was given its modern name for the first time in 1908, with recognition by major kennel clubs occurring around the same time.,The breed remains very popular in the UK, with multiple wins at Cruft's. It has been in the top third of all breeds in the US since the 1960s. It has been featured in television and film, including in Hamish Macbeth, and in advertising by companies such as Cesar dog food and the Scotch whisky Black & White.,Several breed-specific and non-specific health problems appear in the breed, including a condition in young dogs nicknamed \"westie jaw\" which causes an overgrowth of bone in the jaw of the dog. It can also be prone to skin disorders, with a breed-specific condition called hyperplastic dermatosis occurring. They are a very energetic and boisterous breed, needing regular exercise of around one hour per day.,Commonly, Westies have bright, deep-set, almond-shaped eyes that are dark in colour. Their ears are pointed and erect. Members of the breed typically weigh between 15 and 20 pounds (6.8 and 9.1 kg), and the average height is between 10\u201311 inches (25\u201328 cm) at the withers. The body should be shorter than the height of the dog at the shoulder.They also have a deep chest, muscular limbs, a black nose, and a short, closely fitted jaw with \"scissors\" bite (lower canines locked in front of upper canines, upper incisors locked over lower incisors). The Westie's paws are slightly turned out to give it better grip than flat-footed breeds when it climbs on rocky surfaces. In young puppies, the nose and footpads have pink markings, which slowly turn black as they age. Westies also have short and sturdy tails. Some sources suggest that due to their history as rodent catchers, their tails were bred to be thick so that a Westie trapped in a hole could be easily pulled out by the tail.They have a soft, dense, thick undercoat and a rough outer coat, which can grow to about 2 inches (5.1 cm) long. The fur fills out the face to give a rounded appearance. As puppies develop into adults, their coarse outer coat is normally removed by either \"hand-stripping\", especially for dog-showing, or otherwise clipping. Most Westies are pure white, although there are some light wheaten colour variations." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c584" }, "breed": "Wetterhoun", "origin": "Netherlands", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetterhoun", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Fryzyjski_pies_wodny_u68.jpg/220px-Fryzyjski_pies_wodny_u68.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c71d" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/wetterhoun.jpg", "good_with_children": 0, "good_with_other_dogs": 0, "shedding": 0, "grooming": 0, "drooling": 0, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 0, "playfulness": 0, "protectiveness": 0, "trainability": 0, "energy": 0, "barking": 0, "min_life_expectancy": 13, "max_life_expectancy": 13, "max_height_male": 23, "max_height_female": 23, "max_weight_male": 75, "max_weight_female": 75, "min_height_male": 23, "min_height_female": 23, "min_weight_male": 50, "min_weight_female": 50, "breed": "Wetterhoun" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fff" }, "breed": "Wetterhoun", "contenido": "The Wetterhoun (translated into English as the Frisian Water Dog) is a breed traditionally used as a hunting dog for small game and waterfowl and native to the province of Friesland in the Netherlands.

The breed may also be called the Otterhoun (not to be confused with the Otterhound) or Dutch Spaniel, although it is not a Spaniel-type dog.,The Wetterhoun is a medium-sized dog, measuring at 55-59 centimeters (21.6-23 inches) at the withers and weighing between 25 and 35 kilos (55 and 77 pounds) at maturity. Their coat is thick and curly except for the head, ears, and legs, where it is smoother in texture; the water repellant coat is described as feeling oily to the touch. Coat colour may be solid black or brown, black and white, or brown and white, with or without ticking or roaning. The texture of the coat should not be woolly, as such hair is not water repellent. The ears are low-set and hang flat to the head, and the tail curls tightly over the back. The breed has an unusual, somewhat stern expression due to the shape of the eyes, which distinguishes this breed from others.,The first Wetterhouns lived at least 400 years ago in the Dutch province of Friesland. The breed is believed to have originated from Gypsy dogs, crossed with an indigenous Frisian dog, perhaps the now extinct Old Water Dog. Dogs of this type were kept for the difficult and dangerous hunting of fitch (Mustela putorius) and otter (Lutra lutra) in the water. The dogs were also used for retrieving waterfowl and served as watch dogs. Although the dogs almost disappeared during World War II, fanciers were able to bring the breed back through careful breeding, and it has since gained popularity.,Databases are maintained by the Nederlandse Vereniging voor Stabij- en Wetterhounen (The Dutch Club for the Stabij and Wetterhoun) and De Wetterhoun Vereniging Nederland (The Dutch Wetterhoun Club) for assessing pedigrees and computing inbreeding coefficients.,Internationally, the breed is recognised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in the water dogs section of Group 8. The United Kennel Club recognises the breed in the gun dog group.

The name \u201cZerdava\u201d is Slavic for mustelid, possibly in reference to their Marten-brown color or their treeing behavior when hunting martens. ,There exists very little written evidence on the origin of the Zerdava in Turkey. The most probable is that hunting laika were acquired by trade from Russia as Baltic and Black Sea ports were the primary routes of Russian Fur trade into Europe and parts of Asia though the early Middle Ages. ,Zerdava are a spitz breed with a compact body, triangular, upright ears and a curved tail.  They have a double coat that is always liver brown or a combination of liver brown and white.  The brown is described as marten-like in color, they may be solid liver or a combination of liver and white, such as liver and white-ticked except white tip of tail, piebald, ticked, or liver roan.  At birth, the brown is often almost black in color and the white parts are without ticking. Zerdava will have brown noses and yellow-brown eyes.As is typical with laika, zerdava are hardy and versatile hunters, capable of hunting game of a variety of sizes by treeing small game, stalking large prey silently until cornered, then working as teams to corner jackals, bear and boar.  They are especially prized for their ability to avoid injury while hunt boar, a major pest to corn farmers. They are devoted to their humans and distrust strangers, making them excellent watchdogs.  Puppies need considerable socialization with people to avoid overly shy or aggressive behavior. Zerdava often struggle with being rehomed and will try to escape and find their original owner. Starting in 2016, Turkish Armed Force has training zerdava for a variety of military uses including bomb and narcotic detection, search and rescue and personnel detention.,Zerdava are prized for their excellent health in harsh conditions with minimal care. Like other laika, it is more common for the females to go into estrus only once a year.

The coat, consisting of dense curls, sheds very little. (see Moult) The colour is liver/puce and has a very definite purple hue unlike the colour of any other known breed. The non-shedding characteristic of the coat means that people usually allergic to dogs might have less of an allergic reaction to Irish Water Spaniels (see hypoallergenic).,IWS have several distinguishing characteristics which place them among the more recognizable of all breeds:  The topknot of long, loose curls growing down from the head which often covers the eyes; a \"beard\" growing at the back of the throat often accompanied by \"sideburns\"; and a curled, liver (\"puce\")-coloured coat. The most distinguishing characteristic of these dogs is the smooth \"rat tail\", completely free of long coat except at the base where it is covered for 2\u20133 inches with curls. The face is entirely smooth-coated and, unlike the poodle, should require little or no trimming to stay that way. An IWS is ruggedly built with webbed feet to aid in its powerful swimming.

Its keen sense of working as a team makes it a relatively easy dog to train and discipline.  Because of its great intelligence and quizzical nature, it has the reputation of being the clown of the spaniel family and will do ordinary things in extraordinary ways to achieve that which is asked of it.

In its home country, it is seen by many as a national treasure. Karelian Bear Dogs will hunt a variety of animals. Its quick reflexes and fearless nature have made it very popular for hunting large game including small black bears, moose, and wild boar. It was the breed's ability to hunt bears that earned the breed its name. The Karelian Bear Dog is among the top 10 most common dog breeds in Finland. ,The Karelian Bear Dog originated from the Komi dog. Basic stock dogs originated from the Ladoga Karelia, Olonets Karelia, and East Karelia where they were used for hunting. The breeding was started in 1936 to create a sturdy dog which would bark at big game, and named the Karelian Bear Dog. The first standard was established in 1945 and the first dogs were registered in 1946.The Karelian Bear Dog was used mainly for hunting small fur-bearing animals, such as squirrels and marten. Like the Norwegian Elkhound, the Karelian Bear Dog was also used in hunting moose, lynx, wolf and, as its name would suggest, hunting the Eurasian brown bear. In hunting bear, at least a pair of Bear Dogs would be used to harry the animal, barking loudly, in order to distract the bear while the human hunter came in for the kill.,Karelian Bear Dogs have been used to reduce human-bear conflicts in the U.S., Canada and Japan, through dogs bred by and programs developed and introduced by the Wind River Bear Institute and its Founder Carrie L. Hunt. Larger scale programs have been run by the Institute in coordination with Alberta Parks, Yosemite and Glacier national parks, with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife. Karelian Bear Dogs were introduced in 2004 in Karuizawa, Japan, a popular resort town 170 km northwest of Tokyo, where they reduced the number of bear incidents from 255 in 2006 to four in 2017.,The breed standard for Karelian Bear Dogs and Laikas today calls for a black-and-white marked dog, but originally the breed included individuals with coats of wolf gray of various shades, red coats like the standard spitz, and black-and-tan specimens as well.,Males stand 54\u201360 cm (21\u201324 in) at the withers; females are shorter, at 49\u201355 cm (19\u201322 in). Both sexes weigh about 20\u201330 kg (44.1\u201366 lbs).,The breed has a coat of straight, stiff guard hairs and a fine, soft, thick undercoat. There should be no curl in the hair at all.  The colour should be black with white markings. Often the jet black hair is slightly tinted with brownish highlights on the ends giving it an iridescent quality. The ideal colour percentage is around 70% black and 30% white. The bushy tail curls in a circle over the back in a ring and has a white tip. It falls gently onto the dog's back or to one side. Purebred Karelian Bear Dogs have tails that curve into a circle rather than a sickle. Black speckles in the white sections of fur are considered to be a fault." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4be" }, "breed": "Keeshond", "origin": "Netherlands", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeshond", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Keeshond_Majic_standing_cropped.jpg/220px-Keeshond_Majic_standing_cropped.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6b2" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/keeshond.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 5, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 3, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 5, "playfulness": 5, "protectiveness": 5, "trainability": 5, "energy": 4, "barking": 4, "min_life_expectancy": 12, "max_life_expectancy": 15, "max_height_male": 18, "max_height_female": 18, "max_weight_male": 45, "max_weight_female": 45, "min_height_male": 18, "min_height_female": 18, "min_weight_male": 35, "min_weight_female": 35, "breed": "Keeshond" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5efa" }, "breed": "Keeshond", "contenido": "The Keeshond ( KAYSS-hond, plur. Keeshonden) is a medium-sized dog with a plush, two-layer coat of silver and black fur with a ruff and a curled tail. It originated in Holland, and its closest relatives are the German spitzes such as the Gro\u00dfspitz (Large Spitz), Mittelspitz (Medium Spitz), Kleinspitz (Miniature Spitz), Zwergspitz (Dwarf-Spitz) or Pomeranian.,The Keeshond was previously known as the Dutch Barge Dog, as it was frequently seen on barges traveling the canals and rivers of the Netherlands.  The Keeshond was the symbol of the Patriot faction in the Netherlands during political unrest in the years immediately preceding the French Revolution.,In the late 19th century, the breed was developed in England from imports obtained in both the Netherlands and Germany.  In 1930, the Keeshond was first registered with the American Kennel Club.,A member of the spitz group of dogs, the Keeshond in American Kennel Club (AKC) standard is 17 inches (43 cm) to 18 inches (46 cm) tall and 19.25 inches (48.9 cm) \u00b1 2.4 inches (6.1 cm) in the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) standard and weighs 30 pounds (14 kg) to 40 pounds (18 kg).

Neither coarse nor refined, they have a wedge-shaped head, medium-length muzzle with a definite stop, small pointed ears, and an expressive face.  The tail is tightly curled and, in profile, should be carried such that it is indistinguishable from the compact body of the dog.,Like most spitz-type dogs, the Keeshond has a dense double coat, with a thick ruff around the neck.  Typically, the males of this breed will have a thicker, more pronounced ruff than the females.  The body should be abundantly covered with long, straight, harsh hair standing well out from a thick, downy undercoat.  The hair on the legs should be smooth and short, except for a feathering on the front legs and \"trousers\" on the hind legs.  The hair on the tail should be profuse, forming a rich plume.

It is descended from ancient medium-sized breeds and named after the Kishu region, now Mie Prefecture and Wakayama Prefecture. This breed is similar to the Hokkaido, Shikoku and the Kai Ken. The Japanese originally used this breed of dog for boar and deer hunting. Like the Shiba, they are often quiet. Kishu will stalk prey quietly rather than bark. They are the most commonly used purebred native Japanese breed used for hunting boar to this day.,The Kishu stands 17-22 inches (43\u201355 cm) tall, averages 30\u201360 pounds and is considered a medium-sized dog. The standard only permits solid colored dogs to be shown. Accepted show colors are white, sesame, red, and black & tan (NIPPO only). White is the most common color in the breed. There is only one standard which illustrates white as the preferred coat color. The nose color is black, but with the white coats, flesh-colored noses are permitted. The bite is either scissor or a level bite. The tail is either carried in a sickle or curled over the back. The coat is short, straight, and coarse with a thick undercoat. There is fringe on the cheeks and tail. The ears incline forward and are smaller rather than larger, but should maintain proportion with the head and dog overall.  This breed is tough, agile and friendly.,Kishu Ken are a one person/one family dog. They are courageous and brave as hunters, and will be loyal to their owners. They have a strong prey drive, and will hunt small animals. A few have been known to do well with cats if raised with them. They do well with other dogs if socialized well as puppies, however, Kishu may become combative with other dogs who do not respect their boundaries, or become combative with other dogs when frustrated. They are quite headstrong and willful, making training necessary, but they are devoted and loyal to family, getting along well with children, if raised with them. Kishu Ken like to keep an eye on whatever is going on, and sometimes find a high place to look out from. They can be aloof or shy around strangers. They are easily housebroken, intelligent, and strong willed.,The Kishu Ken is a fairly healthy dog breed that does not suffer from health conditions common to more popular and refined breeds, but there is still very limited data on the breed in or out of its country of origin. Current data through the public Finnish health database KoiraNet suggests that the Kishu Ken may not be as prone to joint deformities as its sibling breeds, where the majority of tested Kishu Ken have been evaluated as having deformity-free hip joints. Elbows have, thus far, had the least favorable evaluations in the Kishu Ken, and elbow dysplasia may be something to screen for in Kishu Ken as more breed-specific data becomes available.Instead of physical deformities that cause health issues, Kishu Ken appear to be prone to allergies and autoimmune illnesses or skin conditions. These are not typically life-threatening, but can require lifelong treatment through regulated diet, environmental awareness, allergy medication, or even steroids depending on the individual. In an informal, owner-reported survey of purebred Kishu Ken, environmental allergies appear the most common health condition. Allergies to grass and dust mites have had particular mention. Autoimmune conditions vary, but a handful of individuals have an allergy-like immune response that causes sores and dermatitis which often responds to and is treated with common steroids. Addison's Disease is also noted in the breed, which is an autoimmune condition that causes an error in hormone production in the adrenal glands. Hypothyroidism is also sometimes observed. In dogs, the most common form of hypothyroidism in dogs is caused by an autoimmune condition, and the Kishu may be at particular risk due to the overall autoimmune condition in the breed.,Eyes are another moderate concern in Kishu Ken. The most common deformity of the eye is known as Persistent Pupillary Membranes according to the Finnish health database. This may or may not cause vision impairment, and each dog must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by a simple eye test. This is not a life-threatening disease and typically requires no treatment. The other known issue is entropion, a genetic defect affecting the eye in which the eyelid turns inward and the lashes scratch the eyeball.  This is likely connected in part to the triangular shape of the eye in the Kishu Ken.  Entropion requires surgery to prevent the loss of vision in the eye and continual pain to the dog." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4c6" }, "breed": "Komondor", "origin": "Hungary", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komondor", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Komondor_delvin.jpg/220px-Komondor_delvin.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c6b6" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/komondor.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 2, "shedding": 1, "grooming": 4, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 5, "trainability": 4, "energy": 3, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 12, "max_height_male": 30, "max_height_female": 27, "max_weight_male": 130, "max_weight_female": 110, "min_height_male": 28, "min_height_female": 25, "min_weight_male": 110, "min_weight_female": 88, "breed": "Komondor" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f03" }, "breed": "Komondor", "contenido": "The Komondor (), also known as the Hungarian sheepdog, is a large, white-coloured Hungarian breed of livestock guardian dog with a long, corded coat.Sometimes referred to as 'mop dogs', the Komondor is a long-established dog breed commonly employed to guard livestock and other property. The Komondor was brought to Europe by the Cumans and the oldest known mention of it is in a Hungarian codex from 1544. The Komondor breed has been declared one of Hungary\u2019s national treasures, to be preserved and protected from modification.,Komondors were brought to Hungary by Cumans, the Turkic speaking, nomadic people who settled in Hungary during the 12th and 13th century. The name Komondor derives from *Koman-dor, meaning \"Cuman dog\".  The breed descends from Tibetan dogs and came from Asia with the Cumans, whose homeland might have been near the Yellow River. In the late 10th century, Mongols began to expand their territories at the expense of the Cumans, forcing them to move westwards. Fleeing from the Mongols, they reached the borders of Hungary in the 12th century. Cumans were granted asylum and settled in Hungary in 1239 under K\u00f6ten Khan. Komondor remains have been found in Cuman gravesites.,The name \"quman-dur\" means \"belonging to the Cumans\" or \"the dog of the Cumans\", thus distinguishing it from a similar Hungarian sheepdog breed which later merged with the Komondor. The name Komondor is found for the first time written in 1544 in the History of King Astiagis by K\u00e1konyi P\u00e9ter, in Early Modern Hungarian. Later, in 1673, Amos Comenius mentions the Komondor in one of his works. ,Today, the Komondor is a fairly common breed in Hungary, its country of origin. Many Komondors were killed during World War II and local stories say that this was because when the Germans (and then the Russians) invaded, they had to kill the dog before they could capture a farm or house that it guarded.,The Komondor is related to the South Russian Ovcharka, the Puli and, by extension, the Pumi, the Mudi, the Polish Lowland Sheepdog, the Schapendoes, the Bearded collie, and the Old English sheepdog. In 1947, the Komondor was used to acquire fresh blood in the rare South Russian Ovcharka. In the 1970s, another Komondor cross was made. It is also believed to be related to the Briard, the Catalonian Sheepdog, the C\u00e3o da Serra de Aires, the Pyrenean Shepherd and the Bergamasco shepherd, but the Bergamasco has flocks unlike the Komondor.The two Hungarian breeds of livestock guardian dogs have evolved independently. This is because the Komondor was developed by a group of people who called it the Kuman-dor, the dog of the Cumans, and the Kuvasz was bred by a different people - the Magyars. For much of Hungary's early history, these two peoples lived in separate areas in Hungary, spoke different languages and so did not mix. As a result, their dogs have little, if any at all, admixture.,The Komondor is a large breed of dog\u2014many are over 30 inches (76 cm) tall\u2014one of the larger breeds of dog. The body is covered with a heavy, matted, corded coat. They have robust bodies, strongly muscled with long legs and a short back. The tail is carried with a slight curl. The body when seen sideways, forms a prone rectangle. The length of body is slightly longer than the height at the withers, approximately 104% of the height at withers. The Komondor has a broad head with the muzzle slightly shorter than half of the length of the head with an even and complete scissor bite. Nose and lips are always black.The minimum height of female Komondors is 25.5 inches (65 cm) at the withers, with an average height of 27.5 inches (70 cm). The minimum height of male Komondors is 27.5 inches (70 cm) with an average height of 31.5 inches (80 cm). No upper height limit is given. Komondor females on average weigh between 88\u2013110 lb (40\u201350 kg) and Komondor males weigh on average between 110\u2013132 lb (50\u201360 kg)." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4c8" }, "breed": "Koolie", "origin": "Australia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koolie", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Pete_may01_web.JPG/220px-Pete_may01_web.JPG", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f05" }, "breed": "Koolie", "contenido": "The Koolie (also known as the Australian Koolie or by the historic misnomer \"German Coolie\") is an Australian dog breed. The Koolie is a working or herding dog which has existed in Australia since the early 19th century when it was bred from imported British working dogs. Robert Kaleski, in an article on Cattle Dogs in the August 1903 issue of the Agricultural Gazette of New South Wales, describes the \"Welsh heeler or merle, erroneously known as the German collie,\" as a \"blue-gray dog about the size and build of a smooth-haired collie, generally with wall eyes.\"  The British background predominated in the dogs that came to be associated with the \"German collie\" name.,There is substantial variation in the Koolie population, as Koolies were bred to exhibit different characteristics in different regions. The breed is based on its ability to work rather than on its conformation. However, most Koolie breeders refer to the Koolie as a breed rather than as a type, and assert that it \"breeds true\", with various types or strains.,The Koolie is a \"herding dog\", one which has a natural instinct to circle widely round sheep and bring them back to their owner. Koolies are known as silent, upright, working dogs. They are used for herding sheep and also for quiet careful work at close quarters at lambing time or for \"shedding\" (cutting out) sheep.,With the demand for farming dogs no longer being what it was, the Koolie has proven it\u2019s worth in many other fields where it is renowned for its sensitivity, athleticism and obedience, excelling in agility, tracking, therapy, disability & emotional support service, and as the ultimate outdoor & family companion, providing they are well trained. ,The Koolie is as diverse as the country it originates from, Australia. In the north of Queensland and New South Wales they are tall, medium boned and agile, bred for mustering cattle over many miles. In New South Wales, they are thicker set and shorter to flush low lying cattle from the dense bush and gullies. In Victoria, one finds the smallest variety of the Koolie, primarily used for sheep. Koolies are bred to meet the needs of the stockman, grazier and farmer; all agile, all with the same ability to adapt to any situation, all with a strong willingness drive. The Koolie vary from 40 to 60 centimetres (16 to 24 in) in size and are a contrast of coat, colour and body type. Most often, they are seen in the merle coat pattern, but can exhibit any combination of colour and coat lengths. The solid red or black Koolie are often mistaken for Kelpies, and some bi-coloured Koolie have been taken for Border Collies by the general public. As all of these breeds share Collie ancestry, they resemble each other." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4ce" }, "breed": "Landseer", "origin": "Canada", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landseer_(dog)", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Landseer.jpg/220px-Landseer.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f0f" }, "breed": "Landseer", "contenido": "The Landseer is a dog that originated in Canada.

The MAS is highly intelligent and biddable. The breed is often trained for dog sports such as herding, agility, obedience, canine freestyle, flyball, and others. The Miniature American Shepherd was recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 2015 and is the club's 186th breed. In September 2019, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) officially accepted the breed.,The MAS was bred first in the United States as a small herding and working dog. The Miniature American Shepherd (at that time still the Miniature Australian Shepherd) was first developed in the late 1960s by breeding what was thought to be small Australian Shepherds, and by the mid-1970s the breed had reached its current desired size. In many areas and kennel clubs the Miniature American Shepherd is still used as a working breed in competitions.The predecessor to MASCUSA was the North American Miniature Australian Shepherd Club of the United States, NAMASCUSA and was the first Parent club registry for the Mini Aussie. The second club to register Mini Aussies Miniature Australian Shepherd Club of America MASCA is currently active but no longer accepts dogs registered as MAS with AKC. AKC MAS dogs  may still breed to Mini Aussies and Australian Shepherds so long as the Australian Shepherd was registered as a Mini Aussie before December of 2015. ,In 1993 the original MASCUSA club was asked by the AKC to change its name. Additionally, Miniature Australian Shepherds could no longer participate under their chosen name as it was too similar to that of an AKC affiliated breed, so the Miniature Australian Shepherd was renamed the North American Shepherd.,In 1993, MASCUSA (the original organization) became the North American Shepherd Club of America. For the next 15 years, there were numerous clubs that were formed, reorganized, and sometimes went defunct, trying to come to a consensus concerning the emerging breed. Enough members were eventually interested in obtaining separate recognition, thus prompting members of NAMASCUSA to approach the AKC. Working as a team with AKC and USASA, the name and breed of Miniature American Shepherd was born. The Miniature Australian Shepherd community is still divided over this compromise. In May 2011, the MASCUSA club was chosen by AKC as the parent club of the newly named Miniature American Shepherd.

With the advent of World War II, many of the families who had bred them left rural areas to work in factories in the war effort. By the end of the 1940s the breed was becoming rare.,Four individuals, Hugh Stephens and Woody Huntsman of Kentucky, Carl McConnell of Virginia, and Dewey Ledbetter of Tennessee are given credit for saving the breed from dying out and setting the Mountain Cur breed standard. In 1956, these four founded the Original Mountain Cur Breeders' Association. Soon after, controversy over the breed standard caused Hugh Stephen and Carl McConnell to leave the OMCBA to found the Stephen Stock Mountain Cur Association.,In the 1980s and 1990s, the Mountain View Cur was developed from the Mountain Cur by Michael and Marie Bloodgood of Afton, New York after WW2.,Mountain Curs are short-coated dogs which come in blue, black, yellow, brown, or brindle coloration. Some individuals will also show white markings on the face or chest. The weight is usually between 30 and 60 pounds, and height is 18-26 inches for males and 16-24 inches for females." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4e2" }, "breed": "Mountain Feist", "origin": "United States", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Feist", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/0809bigun.jpg/220px-0809bigun.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f2d" }, "breed": "Mountain Feist", "contenido": "The Treeing Feist is a  breed of feist from the Southeastern United States.

Used to hunt small game, these dogs were bred from terriers and hounds. These dogs became known as the Treeing Feist; feist is a derivation of fist and is a term used in Southern America for a small fierce dog.  The word treeing refers to their hunting style of running game up into trees and indicating to the hunter which tree the game has climbed. Both the Treeing and Mountain Feist breeds are used to hunt small game, particularly squirrel and rodents, as well as raccoons, opossums, rabbits and for flushing birds.In the 20th century these dogs became increasingly rare and in the early 1980s a group of devotees banded together to prevent their extinction. In 1984 the Mountain Feist Association was formed; in 1985 this was replaced by the American Treeing Feist Association, and this was joined by the Mountain Feist Breeder's Club in 1986, the Mountain Treeing Feist Organization in 1992 and the Traditional Treeing Feist Club in 1999.

It is one of two breeds known as a Welsh Corgi. Pembroke Welsh Corgis descended from the Spitz family of dogs. The other is the Cardigan Welsh Corgi, which descend from the Teckel family of dogs, which also produced the Dachshund.  ,Pembroke Welsh Corgis are famous as the preferred breed of Queen Elizabeth II, who has owned more than 30 Royal corgis during her reign. Although these dogs have been favoured by British royalty for more than seventy years, among the British public they have recently fallen into decline in terms of popularity and demand. However, they remain very popular in the United States. Cities such as New York, Boston, Los Angeles, and San Francisco hold annual \"Corgi Meetups\" in which hundreds of dogs and their owners congregate to spend the day.The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has been ranked 11th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, which states that the breed is considered an excellent working dog.,According to the American Kennel Club, Pembroke Welsh Corgis were ranked 11th most popular breed of dog in 2020.,The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has erect ears that are in proportion to the equilateral triangle of the head. The breed standard indicates that the ears should be firm, medium in size, and tapered slightly to a rounded point. The head should be \"fox-like\" in shape and appearance. Pembroke Welsh Corgis differ from the Cardigan Welsh Corgi by being shorter in length, having smaller ears, and being slightly straighter of leg. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has somewhat lighter markings on each side of the withers caused by changes in the thickness, length, and direction of hair growth.Being a double-coated dog, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi sheds heavily all year around, with peaks in the spring and autumn. With regular brushing, their coat is fairly easy to maintain, as well as naturally water- and dirt repellent (at the exception of \"fluffies\"). Intact females are also known to shed during heat.Breed faults exist and should not be bred on purpose; such as corgis with a very long and thinner coat coming from a recessive gene and red coats present with a bluish cast which have a diluted colour. ,While some outlying Pembroke Welsh Corgis are born with their tail naturally short, the majority often have their tails docked between 2\u20135 days old due to historical tradition or to conform to the Breed Standard.  Artificial docking was not needed for the dog to do its job as a herding dog in the United Kingdom as many claim (since Cardigan Welsh corgis were also herding dogs but never docked) but rather because a non-herding dog was considered a luxury under tax law and attracted a tax, so to demonstrate that their dogs were herding dogs, owners had to ensure the dogs had docked tails. The Kennel Club, the United Kennel Club, and the FCI allow intact tails in Conformation shows. The AKC Standard states tails should be docked no longer than 2 inches (5 cm). In many countries including the United Kingdom, docking has been deemed illegal." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c4fd" }, "breed": "Perro de Pastor Mallorquin", "origin": "Majorca (Balearic Islands, Spain)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorca_Shepherd_Dog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Ca_de_Bestiar.JPG/220px-Ca_de_Bestiar.JPG", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f52" }, "breed": "Perro de Pastor Mallorquin", "contenido": "The Majorca Shepherd Dog (Catalan: Ca de bestiar, Spanish: Perro de pastor mallorqu\u00edn) is a domesticated breed of dog, used in the Balearic Islands of Spain, both for guarding sheep and as a general purpose farm dog.

It comes in both shorthaired and longhaired varieties.,While the timing of its arrival is unknown, the breed came with the conquest of King James I of Aragon or shortly thereafter, and over the centuries the Majorcan Shepherds and foravilers conferred its very own and distinct features, not only from other island dogs, but also its neighbors around the Mediterranean. It was used as a shepherd dog for cattle, a bird dog, and to guard and defend the home.Selection and controlled breeding began in the 1970s, and the breed standard was drafted in 1980.

In the long haired variety, the hair is slightly wavy on the back and can reach over 7 cm in length in the winter. In the long-haired variety the undercoat is well distributed and not thick, showing varying shades of black.  The ears, which are slightly bent from the side, are relatively small, triangular, thick and set high on the head.

By the time of the British occupation of Majorca in the 18th century, both bull-baiting and dog fighting were well established on the island, and the Ca de Bou were favoured by the locals for these blood sports, being renowned for their ferocity and bravery.With the outlawing of bull-baiting and dog fighting on Majorca in the 20th century, the Ca de Bou lost favour and their numbers dwindled to the brink of extinction.

It is related to the Blue Picardy Spaniel, and still has many similarities, but the Picardy Spaniel is the older of the two breeds. It is thought to be one of the two oldest continental spaniel breeds and was favoured by the French nobility, remaining popular for hunting after the French Revolution due to its weather resistant coat that enabled it to hunt in a variety of conditions and terrain. However its popularity waned following the influx of English hunting breeds in the early 20th century. Slightly smaller than an English Setter but larger than most of its spaniel cousins, it has no major health issues although as with many breeds with pendulous ears, it can be prone to ear infections.,The French Spaniel and the Picardy Spaniel are speculated to have stemmed from the Chien d' Oysel described in the writings of Gaston Phoebus. Hunting during this period in France was one of the favourite sports of the nobility and the French type of Spaniel became the favourite hunting dog of the French Royalty. The breed can be seen in paintings dating from this period by artists Alexandre-Fran\u00e7ois Desportes and Jean-Baptiste Oudry. They were also the first breed of dog to be admitted into salons.The breed became more popular still following the French Revolution and the aftermath in which hunting was no longer restricted to the nobility. Although spread throughout France, a large concentration was located in the north west where the weather resistant coat of the breed made it ideal for the wooded and swampy conditions. During the early 19th century, British hunters crossed the channel to hunt in the grounds of north west France. The British brought their own hunting dogs, and this resulted in a change of preference as French hunters switched to English breeds and caused a major blow to the existence of the Picardy Spaniel. In addition the infusion of blood from the English Setter into the local spaniel population created the Blue Picardy Spaniel.,The Epagneul Picard Club was formed in 1921 and was merged with the Club of Blue Picardy Spaniel on 28 July 1937. A further merger took place on 21 May 1980 when these clubs merged with the Pont-Audemer Club to form the Club des Epagneuls Picards, Bleus de Picardie & Pont Audemer.The Picardy Spaniel is recognised by a variety of Kennel Clubs and associations including the North American Kennel Club, American Rare Breed Association, United Kennel Club, and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale.

The Podenco Canario is still used today, primarily in packs, most often for the sport hunting of rabbits. The word \"podenco\" in Spain refers to a certain type of dog, typically rabbit hunters with the same body shape. \"Canario\" is a reference to its region of origin, the Canary Islands.  The Spanish Kennel Club, Real Sociedad Canina de Espa\u00f1a, recognises the following similar dog breeds that use the identifier \"podenco\" in their names: Podenco Andaluz, Podenco Ibicenco, and Podenco Valenciano.[1],ge,The Podenco Canario is a very agile, slender and lightly built but sturdy dog.  There are two distinct sizes of Podenco Canarios.  One is similar to the Ibizan Hound, medium in size, with height at the withers approximately 55 to 64 cm (21.7 to 25.2 ins) for males, females are slightly smaller. Sizes vary with the terrain on which the dog hunts. A second smaller size Podenco Canario has been recognised within the Canary Islands, with height at the withers approximately 30 to 40 cm for males, females slightly smaller.  The short, dense coat should be some shade of red, white, or a combination of red and white, depending on the island and, in some cases, the specific area on some of the islands. There should be no other colour on the coat, or indeed anywhere on the body, as even the dog's nose, nails and skin should be a shade of red, and they are even known to \"blush\" when excited. The neck is long, the head is longer than it is wide, and the large ears are carried fully up. The long tail is usually seen low set but can be raised. The tail is not carried too high when moving. The dog should move in an extended and agile trot. Faults, which indicate that a particular dog should not be bred, include aspects of appearance as well as structural faults that would prevent the dog's ability to move and hunt, such as cow hocks, and crossing of the fore and hind legs at a trot.It is a slightly elongated and very muscular dog with a brown (chocolate), red, or yellow coat, can be accompanied by white, brown, or tan markings, and usually have short fur. They begin to demonstrate hunting instinct in as little as 3 months but can take up to 14 months to develop. When it is pursuing prey, they emit a characteristic staccato repetitive barking, known to some local hunters as \"song of the rabbit\".,The Podenco Canario is found on all of the Canary Islands. The legend is that it had descended from ancient dogs brought to the islands in antiquity from North Africa by the earliest human settlers and isolated there. However, recent genetics studies have concluded that the Podenco is a type of dog more closely related to, and no more primitive than, the rest of the European hunting breeds.A DNA study found that there was evidence of gene flow from the Podenco Canario into the Cirneco dell'Etna from Sicily.,Many foreign nationals and foreign organisations export abandoned and unwanted dogs, and the Podenco Canario forms a large percentage of these dogs." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c516" }, "breed": "Pra\u017esk\u00fd Krysa\u0159\u00edk", "origin": "Czech Republic", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pra%C5%BEsk%C3%BD_Krysa%C5%99%C3%ADk", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Prague_Ratter.jpg/220px-Prague_Ratter.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f70" }, "breed": "Pra\u017esk\u00fd Krysa\u0159\u00edk", "contenido": "The Posavac Hound (FCI No. 154) (Croatian: posavski goni\u010d) is a breed of dog, originating as a hunting dog of the scenthound type.

The breed comes from the French side of the Pyrenees Mountains that separate France and Spain. It is recognised as a separate breed from the closely related Pyrenean Mastiff, which is from the Spanish side of the mountains.,The breed is widely used throughout France as a livestock guardian, particularly in the French Alps and Pyrenees, protecting flocks from predation by wolves and bears. The breed is known as the Great Pyrenees in the United States, where it is also used to protect flocks from various predators.,The Pyrenean Mountain Dog is a traditional breed of the Pyrenees. In France it is usually called the 'Patou'. It is sometimes claimed that its forebears \u2013 and those of the Pyrenean Mastiff \u2013 were white livestock guardian dogs brought to the area from Asia in Roman times, and thus that it is related to Maremmano-Abruzzese Sheepdog of Italy and the Kuvasz of Hungary. Genomic data places it within the same genetic clade as the Pharaoh Hound, Cirneco dell'Etna, and the Ibizan Hound.In the seventeenth century, Madame de Maintenon and Louis, Dauphin of France, brought a dog of this type to the court of King Louis XIV, where they soon became in great demand, the King even naming it the Royal Dog of France. They came to be used by the French nobility to guard their ch\u00e2teaux, particularly in the south of the country. It is sometimes claimed that French settlers brought these dogs with them to Canada and that they are among the forebears of the Newfoundland dog. In the 1830s, Pyrenean Mountain Dogs were used as one of the foundation breeds in the creation of the Leonberger.With the extirpation of wolves from the Pyrenees, the popularity of the breed declined and by the beginning of the 20th century it was on the verge of extinction. Local shepherds sold pups to eager tourists and it is from these pups the breed found its way to Britain and several were registered with The Kennel Club at the beginning of the century, although British interest in the large breed declined during the First World War. French aristocrat and dog authority Bernard Senac-Lagrange is credited with saving the breed from extinction at the beginning of the 20th century, touring the mountains to collect the finest specimens available to form a breeding base. Senac-Lagrange established the first breed club, the  R\u00e9union des Amateurs de Chiens Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, and drew up the first breed standard for the breed in 1923; he also registered the breed as the Chien de Montagne des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es with the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Centrale Canine in the same year. In 1946 the Real Sociedad Canina de Espa\u00f1a recognised the large white livestock guardians on the Spanish side of the Pyrenees as the Pyrenean Mastiff with a slightly different breed standard.In the early 1930s, the Pyrenean Mountain Dog was imported into North America where it is known as the Great Pyrenees. The breed became a favourite in the show ring in both Canada and the United States. In 1935, the American Kennel Club adopted a new breed standard that had a number of deviations from the French original that would not be permitted in France. This standard promoted the exaggeration of certain physical features at the expense of functional form and was later adopted by Britain's Kennel Club. To combat the deterioration of the breed's show lines in their country, in 2011 the British Pyrenean Mountain Dog breed club released a brochure with instructions for show judges not to reward glamorous, heavy-bodied, short-muzzled examples of the breed over lean and muscular examples with weatherproof coats capable of performing their original role in high mountainous regions.,The Pyrenean Mountain Dog is a very large and heavily built breed of livestock guardian dog that, according to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Centrale Canine's breed standard, dogs stand from 70 to 82 centimetres (28 to 32 in) and bitches from 65 to 77 centimetres (26 to 30 in). Healthy adults typically weigh between 55 and 75 kilograms (121 and 165 lb). The breed's head is not overly large in comparison to the body; it has a long, broad and slightly pointed muzzle with lips that are not pendulous and small triangular ears that hang flat to the head. The breed has a short and strong neck, a broad and moderately deep chest and a long tail that hangs low when the dog is at rest but curls over the dog's back when the dog is roused. A distinctive feature of the breed is that it possesses double dewclaws on the hind legs, the absence of which is considered a disqualifying fault in conformation shows.The breed has a long and thick double coat that provides it protection from harsh weather; the long and flat outer coat is particularly long around the neck, tail and backs of the legs, and it has a fine and thick under coat. The breed is predominantly white in colour, with patches of black, badger, grey or various shades of tan found mostly on the head; badger is defined as a mixture of brown, black, grey and white hairs and is commonly seen in puppies but usually fades as the dog ages. Whilst purebred examples of the breed with black patches are seen in litters, such colouration is considered a fault by show dog fanciers and is not permitted in conformation shows." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c522" }, "breed": "Rampur Greyhound", "origin": "India", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampur_Greyhound", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Rampurgreyhound.jpg/220px-Rampurgreyhound.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f7d" }, "breed": "Rampur Greyhound", "contenido": "The Rampur Greyhound is a breed of sighthound native to the Rampur region of Northern India, which lies between Delhi and Bareilly.

The breed is an agile dog with a lean and athletic build; the head is triangular with a semi-flat skull. The eyes are very dark and the Ratonero has a long muzzle, and high set ears that bend over at the tip. The tail is traditionally docked to one quarter of its length, however they may also be born with a natural bobtail.The coat is short and dense, which is typically white.

It is a traditionally docked breed.,The breed originates from Valencia in Spain, where it has traditionally been used to catch rats and other rodents. The breed is thought to have existed since the sixteenth century. There are several theories around the breed's origin, including either that stock from British Fox Terriers may have been introduced to native dogs, or that it is simply that breeding dogs for similar purposes have led to similar results.The breed is recognized by the Real Sociedad Canina de Espa\u00f1a, the national kennel club for Spain, since 2004. The club uses the structure set out by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, and places the breed within Group 3:Terriers, and the subgroup, Section 1:Large and medium-sized terriers.

More recent breeding has focused on the Collie as a show dog, and also companion. The breed specifications call for a distinctive long narrow tapered snout and tipped (semiprick) ears, so some dogs have their ears taped when young. Rough Collies generally come in shades of sable and white (sometimes mahogany), blue merle, tri-colored, and colour-headed white.,Originating in the 19th century, the breed is now well known through the stories of author Albert Payson Terhune about his dog Lad, and later with Eric Knight's character of Lassie and her novels, movies, and television shows.,There is a smooth-coated variety known as a Smooth Collie; some breed organisations, including both the American and Canadian Kennel Clubs, consider smooth-coat and rough-coat collies to be variations of the same breed. Rough Collies closely resemble the smaller Shetland Sheepdogs or \"Shelties\", but the two breeds do not have an exclusive linear relationship.,Both Rough and Smooth collies are descended from a localised variety of herding dog originating in Scotland and Wales. The Scottish variety was a large, strong, aggressive dog, bred to herd highland sheep. The Welsh variety was small and nimble, domesticated and friendly, and also herded goats. When the English saw these dogs at the Birmingham market, they interbred them with their own variety of sheepdogs, producing a mixture of short- and long-haired varieties. After the industrial revolution, dog ownership became fashionable, and these early collies were believed to have been crossed with the Borzoi (Russian Wolfhound) to get a more \"noble\" head (longer muzzle), which is today one of the true characteristics of the Rough Collie. It is not known conclusively if the Borzoi cross made it into the mainstream of the breed.,When Queen Victoria acquired a Rough Collie, after seeing one at Balmoral Castle, they were transformed into something of a fashion item. Continued breeding for show purposes drastically changed the appearance of the dogs; in the 1960s, it was a much taller dog than it is today (in the UK; in the US, the size standard has not been revised downward and dogs have remained between 24-26\"). Earlier dogs were also more sturdy in build and reportedly capable of covering up to 100 miles in one day. In the UK the Rough Collie is no longer used for serious herding, having been replaced by the Border Collie, though in the United States and a number of European countries, there has been a resurgence in the use of the Collie as a working and performance dog.The Collie Club of America is one of the oldest breed-specific clubs in existence in the United States (founded in 1886). The Collie Club in England dates from 1881.Quoted from Collie Club of America:,Unfortunately, the Collie's exact origins are shrouded in obscurity. It has been the subject of much research and speculation. The word \"Collie\" is as obscure as the breed itself. The name has been spelled many different ways: Coll, Colley, Coally and Coaly. Generally, the most accepted origin of the word is \"Coll\" - the Anglo-Saxon word for \"black\".,In the 18th century, the Rough Collie's natural home was in the highlands of Scotland, where he had been used for centuries as a sheepdog. The dogs were bred with great care in order to assist their masters in the herding and guarding of their flock., Without a doubt, it is to the English fancy of the late 1800s that the breed owes its development as a popular show dog. Rough Collies were first exhibited in 1860 at the Birmingham, England dog show, in the generic class \"Scotch Sheep-Dogs\".,In 1879 the first English Rough Collie was imported to this country. It is from England that we find the famous pillars of the breed, from which the American fanciers sought not only their next big winner, but also their foundation stock." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c52f" }, "breed": "Saarloos Wolfdog", "origin": "Netherlands", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saarloos_wolfdog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Bow_bow.jpg/220px-Bow_bow.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f8f" }, "breed": "Saarloos Wolfdog", "contenido": "The Saarloos Wolfdog (Dutch: Saarlooswolfhond, German: Saarlooswolfhund) is a wolf-dog breed originating from the Netherlands by the crossing of a German Shepherd with a Siberian grey wolf. The offspring were then further crossed with German Shepherds.,Leendert Saarloos (1884\u20131969) was a Dutch zoologist and dog breeder who believed that the German Shepherd had become too domesticated and wanted to breed back the more natural properties in order to derive a better working dog. In 1935, he bred a male working line German Shepherd (German: Deutscher Sch\u00e4ferhund, Dutch: Duitse herdershond) to a female Eurasian grey wolf (Canis lupus lupus) from Siberia. He then bred the offspring back with German Shepherds to derive a dog with one quarter wolf blood. The result was a dog that was not useful as a working dog but as companion that is close to nature. The Dutch Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1975. To honour its creator, they named this dog the \"Saarloos wolfdog\". In 1981, the breed was recognized by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI).,In 2015, a DNA study found that the Saarloos wolfdog showed more genetic association with the grey wolf than any other breed, which is in agreement with the documented historical crossbreeding with grey wolves in this breed. In 2016, a major DNA study of domestic dogs found a deep division between the Saarloos wolfdog and all other dogs, highlighting its descent from the crossing of German Shepherds with captive wolves in the 1930s. In 2019, a genomic study found that the amount of grey wolf ancestry possessed by the Saarloos wolfdog is 18\u201333% and the Czechoslovakian wolfdog 11\u201312%.,The Saarloos wolfdog is a strongly built dog whose build, coat and movement is wolf-like.

It is an athletic dog in build, with medium bone, and a strong and muscular body. It moves lightly on its feet and has an elegant march. Its coat is short and dense, providing good protection from the weather. There are three colours: wolf-grey, red and white. Because the wolf-grey genes are dominant, this is the most common colour. Genes for white colour are recessive, making this uncommon although this colour is accepted.

(\"does\" is a local dialect meaning \"swamp\" see e.g. the town of Doesburg) The dogs there had many names, and were not a specific breed as we use the term today. They were the local working dog, adapted to the people, environment, and types of work needed. They were exhibited in early dog shows (in the 1870s) as Domestic herding dog.,The dogs became nearly extinct during World War II, and the modern day breed descends from the few survivors. The Dutch Raad van Beheer (national kennel club) first recognised the breed in 1952, and the first standard was written in 1954.

Traditionally kept as a watchdog and property guardian, the Shar Pei was driven to the brink of extinction in the 20th century. The breed is known in the West for its deep wrinkles, whilst a traditional less wrinkled form is maintained in Hong Kong.,There are no records indicating the origins of the Shar Pei, although it closely resembles effigies of an un-wrinkled type of guard dog kept in southern China during the Han dynasty; some believe the modern breed, along with the Chow Chow, descends from these dogs. The breed has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century.The Shar Pei was once very popular, but the political turmoil in China in the 20th century was to take its toll on the breed and by the 1970s it was close to extinction. In 1973 a Hong Kong businessman named Matgo Law appealed to the international community, in particular the American Kennel Club, to help save the breed; by 1978 the breed was named by The Guinness Book of Records as the world\u2019s rarest breed, with only 60 remaining. The resultant publicity led to great demand in the United States for examples of the breed, and unscrupulous breeders in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan took to crossing their remaining purebred animals with other breeds including the Bull Terrier, Pug and Bulldog, and selling the offspring to unwitting American buyers. The results of the crossings led to a dog with a much fleshier mouth than the original breed, these dogs became known as \"meat-mouth\" Shar Peis, whilst the original dogs are called \"bone-mouth\" Shar Peis.The cause of saving the breed was taken up in the United States by enthusiastic breeders using the dogs smuggled there in the 1970s, a breed club was founded and it received American Kennel Club recognition in 1992, with breed standard specifying a meat-mouth type dog. Some breeders in Hong Kong maintain the traditional bone-mouth type, although it is estimated only 50 to 100 examples of this type remain.In the United States, a number of breeders have selectively bred Shar Peis for a smaller size, creating what they call the Miniature Shar Pei, much to the opposition of many breeders of traditionally sized Shar Peis. Standing to a maximum 40 centimetres (16 in), the Miniature Shar Pei is bred for both for its smaller size and increased wrinkles.,The Shar Pei is a short-coated medium-sized breed of dog, renowned for its excessively wrinkled skin. The breed resembles many dog breeds from the mastiff family; however, it is most closely related to spitz breeds, with the Chow Chow being its closest relative. This is most clearly seen with the two breeds both possessing unique blue-black tongues. This dog falls within the same genetic group as the Chow Chow, the Akita, the Shiba Inu, the Malamute and the Greenland dog.Adult Shar Peis typically stand between 44 and 51 centimetres (17 and 20 in) and weigh between 16 and 20 kilograms (35 and 44 lb), they have a short, very harsh coat that can be any solid colour except white, although black, red, fawn and cream are the most common.The Chinese breed standard states they have clam-shell ears, butterfly nose, melon-shaped head, grandmotherly face, water buffalo neck, horse's buttocks and dragon's legs. The breed's head is relatively large compared to its body with a broad muzzle that usually darker than the rest of the coat and well padded causing a bulge at its base, the ears are set wide apart and are small and triangular, and the eyes are set very deeply into the folds of skin on the head. The breed has straight, well boned, muscular legs below sloping shoulders and a medium length broad tail that is curled over their back in a manner typical of spitz-type dogs.,Because of its popularity after being introduced to North America in the 1970s, the breed suffered much inexperienced or rushed breeding. This resulted in not only a dramatically different look for the Shar Pei (as its most distinctive features, including its wrinkles and rounded snout, were exaggerated), but also many health problems. The American breed club states that few Shar Peis reach the age of 10 and it has a longevity program recording those dogs that live to 10 years or more.Compared to other breeds, Shar Peis have an increased risk of developing atopic dermatitis, a chronic allergic skin disease. Dogs with allergic skin disease often get allergy-induced skin infections. Shar Peis are also at an increased risk of demodicosis, a disease which happens when Demodex canis mites proliferate and cause skin irritation, inflammation and infection.Familial Shar Pei fever (FSF) is a serious congenital disease that causes short fevers lasting from 24 hours to sometimes up to three days and usually accompanied by accumulation of fluid around the ankles (called Swollen Hock Syndrome). Amyloidosis, a long-term condition, is most likely related to FSF, caused by unprocessed amyloid proteins depositing in the organs, most often in the kidneys or liver, leading eventually to kidney failure. The disease is associated with the Western type and it is estimated that 23% are affected. The Australian breed standard was changed in 2009 to discourage breeding for heavy wrinkling.A common problem is a painful eye condition, entropion, in which the eyelashes curl inward, irritating the eye. If untreated, it can cause blindness. This condition can be fixed by surgery (\"tacking\" the eyelids up so they will not roll onto the eyeball for puppies or surgically removing extra skin in adolescent and older Shar Peis). In Australia, more than eight in 10 Shar Peis require surgery to correct eye problems, contributing to them being the most expensive breed to insure.The Shar Pei is also prone to chronic yeast infections in its ears. This is due to a tight inner ear structure with a wrinkled appearance, making cleaning very difficult; exacerbated by the tight \"flap\" that the ear creates over the canal, promoting a moist environment.Vitamin B12 deficiency is a common problem in the Shar Pei and is suspected to be hereditary." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c54b" }, "breed": "Sinhala Hound", "origin": "Sri Lanka", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhala_Hound", "img": "Not available", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fb3" }, "breed": "Sinhala Hound", "contenido": "The Sinhala Hound is a landrace of dog from Sri Lanka.,The Sinhala Hound is the native dog found throughout Sri Lanka, often living in a semi-wild state scavenging for food.

Despite the multiple renderings in English, these refer to only one breed. The United Kennel Club in the US uses the English version of the name Slovak Cuvac.,A good watchdog, guard, shepherd and companion, the dog proved itself also in watching cattle, turkeys, and other domestic animals - as well as its master's household. Holiday makers and visitors to the mountains and spas took to this breed and began to carry it to the lowlands. The Slovensky Cuvac is used on sheep farms and mountain ridges as well as homes and frontiers. He is boundlessly loyal and stout hearted. He resists every enemy - bears and wolves included. According to the time honored shepherd's tradition, he is always bred in white to be discernible from the beasts of the night.,This breed has been well documented as far back as the 17th century. However, as wolves slowly began to disappear from European mountains and modern herding practices were instituted, the Cuvac was faced with the prospect of being seen as a relic of the past. What few specimens were left in the 1950s were bred carelessly. Credit for reviving the breed and fixing characteristics is due Dr. Antonin Hruza, in cooperation with the veterinary school of Brno.,The registered breeding of the Slovensky Cuvac was established in Czechoslovakia by Professor Antonin Hruza from the Veterinary Faculty in Brno on June 4, 1929. The Club of the Breeders of Slovak Cuvac was established in 1933 and a written standard was established and approved in 1964 Dr. V. Kurz). The basic breeding material came from the vicinity of Liptovska Luzna, Kokava and Vychodna as well as from Rachov in the Carpathians.,The body of Slovak Cuvac is slightly longer than higher. Strong and straight ridge goes - way to lower back - a little bit sloped. Strong square butt is slightly sloped, too. The low-placed tail is worn hanging, reaching hock joints. Chest reaching to elbow joint and chest's width can compared to circa one quarter of scapula's height. Ribs are well rounded and achieving long back. Belly and flanks are slightly pulled.

It hails from the Dutch province of Friesland; its origins lie in the forested region of eastern and southeastern Friesland. The breed has been mentioned in Dutch literature dating back to the early 1800s, but it was not until the 1960s that the breed became known outside its native province; the first Stabyhouns left the Netherlands some decades later, in the 2000s. The name Stabijhoun translates roughly to \"stand by [me] dog\". The dog is considered a Dutch national treasure. Today, there are only a few thousand Stabyhouns worldwide.,The Stabyhoun is mentioned in the early 19th century Frisian literature of Joost Halbertsma, Waling Dijkstra, and Nynke fan Hichtum. Historically, this breed was used for hunting foxes, small game, and birds. A fixture on Frisian farms, Stabyhouns have proven to be skillful mole-catchers. During the hunting season, it was used as an all-round gun dog. Today, the Stabyhoun remains a competent hunter, although British and German hunting breeds remain more popular. Known for its calm disposition, the Stabij is a soft-mouthed retriever, a fine pointer, excellent tracker, and a good alert dog. It has also been used by dairy farmers as a cart dog.,These dogs used to be found nearly exclusively on farms, whose owners had limited means and needed a general-purpose farm dog capable of working, hunting, and keeping watch, whilst being a faithful and reliable family companion.,The breed's appearance and purpose have not changed. In order to optimise the traits of the working farm dog in earlier days, the Stabyhoun was often mixed with another old and rare Frisian breed, the Wetterhoun, whose rugged coats and huskier physiques made Stabijs more robust. However, in 1942 the Stabyhoun received official breed recognition, and crossbreeding of the Stabyhoun and Wetterhoun ceased altogether in an effort to prevent the extinction of these increasingly rare breeds.,Today, the Stabyhoun enjoys a small but devoted following amongst Dutch sportsmen and families. Its numbers are increasing slowly but steadily. This breed has caught the attention of dog lovers in the United Kingdom, Scandinavia, and North America." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c55c" }, "breed": "Standard Schnauzer", "origin": "Germany", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Schnauzer", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Emppumenossa.jpg/220px-Emppumenossa.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c70a" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/standard_schnauzer.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 1, "grooming": 3, "drooling": 3, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 5, "trainability": 5, "energy": 3, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 13, "max_life_expectancy": 16, "max_height_male": 19.5, "max_height_female": 19.5, "max_weight_male": 50, "max_weight_female": 45, "min_height_male": 18.5, "min_height_female": 18.5, "min_weight_male": 35, "min_weight_female": 30, "breed": "Standard Schnauzer" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fc8" }, "breed": "Standard Schnauzer", "contenido": "The Schnauzer or Standard Schnauzer (Mittelschnauzer) is a dog breed that originated in Germany in at least 14th\u201315th century, of Schnauzer breed type and progenitor of the Giant Schnauzer and Miniature Schnauzer. Initially it was called Wire-Haired Pinscher, while Schnauzer was adopted in 1879. The literal translation is \"snouter\" from the German word for \"snout\" and means colloquially \"moustache\", or \"whiskered snout\", because of the dog's distinctively bearded snout.Generally classified as a working or utility dog, this versatile breed is robust, squarely built, medium-sized dog with aristocratic bearing. It has been claimed that it was a popular subject of painters Sir Joshua Reynolds, Albrecht D\u00fcrer and Rembrandt, but actual proof remains elusive. Standard Schnauzers are either salt-and-pepper or black in color, and are known for exhibiting many of the \"ideal\" traits of any breed. These include high intelligence, agility, alertness, reliability, strength, and endurance. This breed of dog has been very popular in Europe, specifically Germany, where it originated. The breed was first exhibited at a show in Hanover in 1879, and since then has taken top honors in many shows, including the prestigious \"Best in Show\" at Westminster Kennel Club\" in the United States in 1997.,In the Middle Ages, Schnauzer-type dogs of medium size were developed as a versatile multifunctional breed from herding and working breeds in Germany (W\u00fcrttemberg and Bavaria). Historians and cynologists theorize that it has a common ancestry with the German Pinscher as a rough-coated variant of the Pinscher breed, and that it was possibly crossed with a black German Poodle and a gray Wolf Spitz, and perhaps also a Bolognese dog. Such a variety would have been more useful in winter, and in livestock-driving and vermin-hunting roles.A dog of the peasant farmers for centuries, they finally captured the interest of German dog fanciers at the advent of dog shows in the 19th century; the Schnauzer's look and temperament were standardized for the show ring. By 1850, it was recognized as a distinct purebred dog. Those early dogs had many recognizable features, such as thick facial hair, wiry double coat, elegant necks, and cropped tails. The breed takes its name from one of their kind, a medium-sized show dog named \"Schnauzer\", who won at the 1879 Hanover Show in Germany. Since the 1900s the breed universally started to be called as Schnauzer. It is considered that the word itself appeared for the first time in 1842 when Jeremias Gotthelf used it as a synonym for the Wire-Haired Pinscher, which was also known as Wire-Haired German Pinscher, Rauhaar Pinscher (Rough-Haired Terrier), Rattenfanger, Ratter. By the name \"Wire-Haired German Pinscher\" it received first German breed standard in 1880 (or 1884), and initially having a wide variety of coat colors, between 1885-1890 were introduced black and pepper-and-salt color variations which would become dominant colors in 1907 breed standard. In this period has developed a standard with more elegant head, more prominent beard, and eyebrows, as well as overall appearance. The Pinscher-Schnauzer Club was founded in 1895 and is still active.Although it is claimed that the first Standard Schnauzer in the United States was shown in the Miscellaneous Class at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in New York City in 1899, and European immigrants could have brought it with them, the first official import was recorded in 1905, named Fingal. However, it became more popular only after World War I, where the German army used it to carry small packages while the Red Cross for guard duty and other aides. The Wire-Haired Pinscher Club of America was founded in 1925. The club was for both Standard and Miniature Schnauzers, but since 1933 the club was divided for separate promotion, one of them being Standard Schnauzer Club of America. Initially, American Kennel Club (AKC) classified it in the Working Group, but in 1926 were moved to Terrier Group, which was reverted in 1945 or 1946. It was imported into England circa 1926, within two years, was formed Schnauzer Club of Great Britain, and in the late 1930s received challenge certificates. CKC also includes it in the Working Group, UKC includes it in Guardian Group, the KC, ANKC and NZKC include it in the Utility Group, while by the VDH and FCI Schnauzer is placed in \"Group 2, Section 1: Pinschers and Schnauzers\", with \"Nr. 182\" in \"Section 1.2\" dedicated to the Standard Schnauzer breed.,Distinguished by their long beards and eyebrows, Standard Schnauzers are almost always pepper and salt or less commonly black in color, with a stiff and wiry hair coat on the body similar to that of other wirehaired breeds. Their hair will perpetually grow in length without properly shedding, but contrary to popular belief Standard Schnauzers are not hypo-allergenic and they all shed to some degree. The more wiry \u2013 and correct and weather-resistant \u2013 the coat, the more that the coat will shed, though the hair dropped from a single dog is said to be nearly unnoticeable.,One author has ranked the Standard Schnauzer 18th out of 140 breeds within 79 ranks on the ability to learn and obey known commands." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c55d" }, "breed": "Stephens Stock", "origin": "United States", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephens_Stock", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Stephens_Cur.jpg/220px-Stephens_Cur.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fc9" }, "breed": "Stephens Stock", "contenido": "The Stephens Stock, also known as the Stephens Stock Mountain Cur or simply the Stephens Cur, is a breed of cur from the United States.,The Stephens Stock is a small, compact scent hound-like cur that stands between 16 and 23 inches (41 and 58 cm) in height and weighs between 35 and 55 pounds (16 and 25 kg).

The breed is vocal with a distinctive bay that allows its owner to identify their hound from great distances. It has a clear, ringing voice that changes to a steady chop at the tree. Treeing Walker Coonhounds are gentle, calm, friendly dogs who make great house pets.,The Treeing Walker Coonhound was developed in the Colonial era from crosses of English Foxhounds. Two breeders from Kentucky, John W. Walker, and George Washington Maupin, are given credit for the breed's initial development. The dogs they bred were referred to as Walker Hounds and were used to hunt raccoons.,In the 1800s, a stolen black and tan dog named Tennessee Lead was crossed into the Walker Hound. Tennessee Lead was of unknown origin, but he greatly influenced the Walker. The Walker Coonhound, Treeing, was first recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) in 1905 as a part of the English Coonhound breed, at the request of breeders. The name was later changed to Treeing Walker Coonhound, and it was fully recognized as a separate breed in 1945. It was recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in January 2012, making it the AKC's 174th recognized breed.,The Treeing Walker Coonhound may give an impression of a working dog. According to the UKC standard, it may stand 20 to 27 inches high at maturity, with weight in proportion. The common weight range is 50 to 70 pounds, with males being larger than females.The skull should be broad, with a long muzzle and long, hanging ears. Eyes are dark and have a soft expression. All four legs should be straight when viewed from the front or back, with cat-like, compact feet. In conformation shows, blindness or deafness is a disqualification. ,The smooth coat is fine and glossy and comes in a tricolor and a bi-color pattern. Tricolor, white with black and tan markings, is preferred, although bi-color dogs, black and white or tan and white, are acceptable.The Treeing Walker Coonhound has a clear bay on the trail, which should change to a distinct \"chop\" when treed. Its temperament should be kind but fearless and courageous on the hunt.,The Treeing Walker Coonhound is bred primarily for the mouth, looks, and ability.

They are scent hounds, bred to hunt foxes by scent., In 1650, Robert Brooke sailed from England to Maryland with his pack of hunting dogs, which were the root of several strains of American hounds. Dogs of this bloodline, known as \"Brooke Hounds,\" remained in the Brooke family for nearly 300 years, possibly one of the longest documented breeding records for a single breed and family. George Washington received French Foxhounds, Grand Bleu de Gascogne, (which look much like an American Bluetick Coonhound) as a gift from the Marquis de Lafayette. Many of the dogs Washington kept were descended from Brooke's, and when crossed with the French hounds, helped to create the present-day American Foxhound. The American Foxhound is known to have originated in the states of Maryland and Virginia, and is the state dog of Virginia.The breed was developed by landed gentry purely for the sport of hunting foxes. With the importation (or migration) of the red fox, Irish Foxhounds were added to the lines, to increase speed and stamina in the dog, qualities still prevalent in today's dogs. One quality that the American Foxhound is famous for is its musical bay that can be heard for miles. This is one reason why this breed does not do well in city settings.The breed was first recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1886. Today, there are many different strains of American Foxhound, including Walker, Calhoun, Goodman, Trigg, July and Penn-Marydel. Though each strain looks different, they are all recognized as members of the same breed. Most show hounds are Walkers, many of the pack hounds (used with hunting foxes on horseback) are Penn-Marydel and hunters use a variety of strains to suit their hunting style and quarry.,While standards call for the American Foxhound to be about 21\u201325 in (53\u201364 cm) tall to the withers, and weigh anywhere between 55\u201371 lb (25\u201332 kg), many of them are larger in structure (especially the show strains), with males standing 26\u201329 in (66\u201374 cm) and females 25\u201328 in (64\u201371 cm) and smaller in weight, typically between 45\u201365 lb (20\u201329 kg). The legs of a Foxhound are long and straight-boned. The foxhound's chest is rather narrow. It has a long muzzle, and a large, domed skull. The ears are wide and low-set.

The old Harrier was a slow moving, deep scenting hound breed that was closely related to the Southern Hound, and the hunts were traditionally followed on foot. From the 19th century, significant Foxhound blood was introduced into most Harrier packs, or frequently packs adopted pure Foxhound lines that were slightly bred down in size. This change was to produce faster hounds, and hare hunts began to be followed on horseback in a similar manner as fox hunting.It is believed the West Country Harrier is more closely related to the old Harrier breed, without significant infusions of Foxhound blood. Parson Jack Russell described the West Country Harrier as being descended from the old style Harrier and the now extinct Staghound, the later having been introduced by several enthusiasts including Parson John Froude.

It is sometimes considered to be Dutch in ancestry, due to the nationality of the breed founder, Eduard Karel Korthals.  History records the progression of the development of the breed through Biebesheim am Rhein, Germany where the founder established the Ipenwoud kennel and the breed type was established and then into France where it is now recognized.  Others consider the Griffon to be a German breed because Korthals' kennel, Ipenwoud, was located in Biebesheim am Rhein, Germany.  It was there for over twenty years that Korthals dedicated his life to the development  and perfection of the Korthals Griffon.,The breed is still relatively rare in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom despite long recognition by their respective national kennel clubs, as well as the FCI (Federation Cynologique Internationale).  The Korthals Griffon is particularly adapted for hunting in thick undergrowth and around water, where its harsh coat is excellent protection.  The griffon is used primarily as a hunting dog for upland game birds as well as waterfowl.,The Korthals Griffon is a strong medium-sized dog (20-22\" for females, 22-24\" for males) and 65 pounds for females and 75 pounds for males with a harsh, wiry outer coat and a softer under coat.  The coat is preferably steel gray with brown markings.  Other acceptable colors: chestnut brown, white and brown, roan, and white and orange. All brown, all white or white and orange are less desirable.  A black coat disqualifies.The griffon has a large and long head, with large rounded eyes covered with eyebrows and complemented with a beard.  The nose is always brown.  The neck is long and body well proportioned and muscular.  Depending on the country, the tail may be docked.,Eduard Karel Korthals is credited with the breed around 1873. Korthals' dream was to create the ideal versatile gun dog; one with extreme resiliency, vigor, and devotion to its master.  The dog would also have to work close to its master, and be open to training.,Korthals' breeding line began in 1874 with \"Mouche\", who would be used as its foundation bitch, as well as five other dogs described as \"Griffons\": Janus, Satan, Banco, Hector, and Junon.  He interbred the dogs carefully until offspring were produced that resembled his idea of an ultimate hunting dog.  In any event, the resulting offspring (Moustache I, Lina, and Querida) are referred to as the \"Korthals Patriarchs\" because they are the Griffon's direct ancestors.  In 1888 the first \"griffon club\" was formed as an international organization with local clubs in Bavaria \"Southern German Griffon Clue\" in 1895, in Belgium the \"Royal Belgium Griffon Club\" (1895) in France \"French Wirehaired Griffon Club (1901) soon followed.,The American Kennel Club's first registered Korthals Griffons (called Wirehaired Pointing Griffon in the USA) was \"Zolette\", who was entered into the stud book in 1887.  However, the Griffon was still relatively unknown, and she was registered as a \"Russian Setter (Griffon)\" for her presumed Russian heritage.  It was not until 1916, twenty-nine years later, that the breed was officially recognized as the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon in the United States.  In that same year, sixteen Griffons appeared in the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, one of the most prestigious shows in the country.  Since then, the breed has grown in popularity as not only a show dog but also a versatile gun dog, Korthals' original intention for the breed.  For the most part, the breed still resembles his original intentions: a medium size, harsh coat, good degree of trainability, and resilient on the field and in the ring." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c58b" }, "breed": "Xiasi Dog", "origin": "China", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiasi_Dog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Xiasi_Quan_dog.jpg/220px-Xiasi_Quan_dog.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd6006" }, "breed": "Xiasi Dog", "contenido": "Xiasi Dog (or Xiasi Quan) is a breed of dog named after the village of Xiasi, prefecture of Kaili, Guizhou Province in China is now accepted in most Chinese dog shows.

Yakutian Laikas are multipurpose laikas,  able to herd reindeer, hunt game and pull a sled. They are registered with the Russian Kennel Club, the FCI and the AKC's Foundation Stock Service.,This is a versatile dog with excellent sense of smell, hearing and vision, strong hunting drive, endurance; they are aggressive to predators and soft and gentle to humans. Like most of the aboriginal laika breeds, the Yakutian Laika is multi-purpose, expected to excel as a sled dog, but also to hunt game and herd reindeer and cattle. Yakutian Laikas are tolerant regarding living conditions and easily endure the hostile climate of northern Siberia, even when left to fend for themselves. In harsh Siberian conditions they reveal their stamina; they tend to work in small groups and can work through the whole day, from dawn to sunset.,Yakutian Laikas are a breed with ancient origins developed by native Yakuts for hunting mammals and birds, herding livestock and hauling game back to camp. The dogs were indispensable assistants and companions. In the Sakha language, this breed is known as \"Sakha yta\" meaning \"Yakut dog\". Evidence of this breed can be found in archaeological remains dating 12,500 years ago. Remnants of dog sleds and harnesses has been found with dog remains in the Sakha republic radiocarbon dated to 7800\u2013800 years ago. It is very likely that these remains were the ancestor of the Yakutian Laika,The Kungur Chronicle and the Remezov Chronicle, created at the end of the 16th century and 1703 respectively, tells about the people living along Siberian rivers, whose primary means of transport was riding on reindeer or dogs. In these documents, the rivers Olenyok, Yana, Indigirka and Kolyma were called \u201cdog rivers\u201d, as they were rich in fish for the dogs to eat. Rivers where there is no fish or it is not enough to feed the dogs, reindeer are used for transportation, and such rivers were called \"deer rivers.\",With the increased demand for white polar foxes in the 17th century, Arctic exploration received its spike. Furs and mammoth tusks trade became local nations\u2019 main income. Origin and subsequent formation of the breed are still not quite known, but because of the hard to access country and extreme natural conditions, Yakutian Laikas have lived as primitive aboriginal breeds; they were rarely confined and mated freely. Naturally, local type dogs could be preserved only under conditions of complete isolation from dogs of other breeds. First scientific descriptions of dogs of Yakutia were published in late 18th century, when first geographic studies of the north were conducted. Prince Shirinsky-Shikhmatov wrote in his monograph about Laikas: \u201cResearchers of the north, of course, could not overlook northern dog; they could not disagree with hard fact that presence of this dog makes life of northern people possible.,In 1896, V. L. Seroshevsky published a book \u201cYakuts\u201d, edited by N. I. Veselovsky. Describing dogs of Yakuts, Seroshevsky divides them into two groups, 1) guarding and hunting dogs and 2) maritime sled dogs. He wrote: \u201ceven most poor Yakut having no other animals, has at least one dog\u201d. Yokhelson (Johelson?), 1898, in his publication \u201cHunting Industry in Kolyma Territory of Yakutian Province\u201d and described the Tungus Lajka used for sledding and hunting dogs.,He wrote: \u201cThere are two breeds of dogs, one is so-called Tungus Laika, a pointed-eared dog of nomadic reindeer herders and polar sled dog\u201d. All researchers described dogs of Yakutia as one breed of \u201cpolar sled dogs\u201d. Yokhelson wrote: \u201cSled dog is a burden animal not only of nomads living in not forested country, but also of settled near the river Russians and russified minorities and the dog of majority of cattle keeping Yakuts. Except southwestern part of the territory, one can find 5-6 dogs in every yurta, which are used for hauling firewood and other works needed by the household. The polar dog is not big, 50-60 cm at the shoulder\u2026 In the appearance, with his prick ears, oblique set eyes, thick coat and broad massive head, pointed muzzle, low carried tail (when the dog is tired, eats or in a bad mood), the dog is very similar to wolf. Among them, there are shaggy dogs, and somewhat blunt muzzle not different from our Spitzes \u2026 Generally, type of Kolyma sled dog is diverse and, perhaps, it is a mix between Kamchatka and Eskimo sled dogs with another imported breed.\u201d" }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c58e" }, "breed": "Yorkshire Terrier", "origin": "Yorkshire, \u00a0England", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_Terrier", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/%282_version%29_Grupp_3%2C_YORKSHIRETERRIER%2C_NO_UCH_SE_UCH_Oxzar_Amazing_Bel%E2%80%99s_Toffy_%2824310212305%29.jpg/220px-%282_version%29_Grupp_3%2C_YORKSHIRETERRIER%2C_NO_UCH_SE_UCH_Oxzar_Amazing_Bel%E2%80%99s_Toffy_%2824310212305%29.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c723" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/yorkshire_terrier.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 1, "grooming": 5, "drooling": 1, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 5, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 5, "trainability": 4, "energy": 4, "barking": 4, "min_life_expectancy": 11, "max_life_expectancy": 15, "max_height_male": 8, "max_height_female": 8, "max_weight_male": 7, "max_weight_female": 7, "min_height_male": 7, "min_height_female": 7, "min_weight_male": 7, "min_weight_female": 7, "breed": "Yorkshire Terrier" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd6009" }, "breed": "Yorkshire Terrier", "contenido": "The Yorkshire Terrier (often shortened as Yorkie) is one of the smallest dog breeds of the terrier type, let alone of any dog breed.

Breeding of the Yorkshire terrier was \"principally accomplished by the people\u2014mostly operatives in cotton and woollen mills\u2014in the counties of Yorkshire and Lancashire.\"  In the 1800s, miners wanting to develop a ratting terrier, bred Black-and-Tan Terriers with the Paisley and Clydesdale Terriers. Details are scarce. Mrs A. Foster is quoted as saying in 1886, \"If we consider that the mill operatives who originated the breed were nearly all ignorant men, unaccustomed to imparting information for public use, we may see some reason why reliable facts have not been easily attained.\"The breed comes from three distinct dogs, a male named Old Crab, a female named Kitty, and another female whose name is not known. The Paisley Terrier, a smaller version of the Skye Terrier that was bred for a beautiful long silky coat, also figured into the early dogs. Some authorities believed that the Maltese was used as well. \"They were all originally bred from Scotch Terriers (meaning dogs from Scotland, not today's Scottish Terrier) and shown as such the name Yorkshire Terrier was given to them on account of their being improved so much in Yorkshire.\" Yorkshire Terriers were shown in a dog show category (class) at the time called \"Rough and Broken-coated, Broken-haired Scotch and Yorkshire Terriers\". Hugh Dalziel, writing in 1878, says that \"the classification of these dogs at shows and in the Kennel Club Stud Book is confusing and absurd\" in lumping together these different types.In the early days of the breed, \"almost anything in the shape of a Terrier having a long coat with blue on the body and fawn or silver coloured head and legs, with tail docked and ears trimmed, was received and admired as a Yorkshire Terrier\". But in the late 1860s, a popular Paisley-type Yorkshire Terrier show dog named Huddersfield Ben, owned by a woman living in Yorkshire, Mary Ann Foster, was seen at dog shows throughout Great Britain, and defined the breed type for the Yorkshire Terrier.,Huddersfield Ben was a Yorkshire Terrier whose portrait was painted by George Earl and in 1891 an authority on the breed wrote, \"Huddersfield Ben was the best stud dog of his breed during his lifetime, and one of the most remarkable dogs of any pet breed that ever lived; and most of the show specimens of the present day have one or more crosses of his blood in their pedigree.\" A show winner, Huddersfield Ben, through his puppies, helped define the Yorkshire Terrier breed. He is still referred to as \"father of the breed.\"" }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c592" }, "breed": "Argentine Polar Dog", "origin": null, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_Polar_Dog", "img": "Not available", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5df5" }, "breed": "Argentine Polar Dog", "contenido": "The following is a list of extinct dog breeds, varieties and types.,Alderton, David (2000).

Other names used for these hybrids were half-and-halfs and half-breds. It was a time in history when, for thousands of years, dogs were classified by use or function, unlike the modern pets that have evolved into show dogs and family pets.:\u200a14\u200a The bull and terrier crosses were originally bred to function as fighting dogs for bull and bear baiting, and other blood sports that were popular during the Victorian era. The sport of bull baiting required a dog with attributes such as tenacity and courage, a wide frame with heavy bone, and a muscular, protruding jaw. By crossing bulldogs with various terriers from Ireland and Great Britain, breeders introduced \"gameness and agility\" into the hybrid mix.Little is known about the pedigrees of bull and terrier crosses, or any other crosses at that time. The types and styles of dogs varied geographically depending on individual preferences. Breeders in one area may have preferred a cross with a higher percentage of terrier than bulldog. Some early anecdotal reports indicate that bulldog to terrier was preferred over bull and terrier to bull terrier, which was likely to have resulted in at least half or more bulldog blood. The bull and terrier was never a bona fide breed; rather, it referred to a heterogeneous group of dogs that may include purebreds involving different breeds, as well as dogs believed to be crosses of those breeds. Those crossbreeds or hybrids are considered the forerunner of several modern standardised breeds.In the mid-1830s, when enforcement of the ban on bull baiting had begun, the popularity of the original purebred bulldogs declined, and a major shift in canine genetics was occurring. The appearance of certain dogs were being altered by crossbreeding to better suit function. Not only were appearances of dogs changing, so was the terminology used to describe various breeds and dog types as recorded in ancient records. Such changes began casting doubts over the bulldog's earliest known ancestors.,One example of how changing terminology over the centuries has caused confusion is the ubiquitous misuseage of descriptors. For example, the ubiquitous use of mastiff as a common descriptor for all large dogs, created a cloud over the earliest origins of the bulldog. The Alaunt was once believed to be the likely ancestor of bulldogs and mastiffs, both of which came from Asia; others believed bulldogs descended only from mastiffs.Over the centuries, hybrid bull and terrier crosses have been labeled with several aliases, such as half-and-half, half-bred, pit dog, bulldog terrier and pit bulldog. The most popular name was bull-terrier, a name later applied to the breed James Hinks was developing in the latter half of the 19th century. There are also many paintings, texts, and engravings created during or prior to this period that labeled the bull-and-terrier only as \"bull-terrier\". Hinks was still developing his new bull terrier, nicknamed White Cavalier, which he presented at the Birmingham show in May 1862.The term pit bull terrier was sometimes applied, though later applied when naming the American Pit Bull Terrier, a modern standardised breed. The term \"pit bull\" is a ubiquitous term that is often misused to infer that the pit bull is a bona fide breed of dog, when it actually refers to a diverse group of dogs that may include purebred dogs of many breeds as well as dogs that are assumed to be blends of those breeds. These types of descriptors vary, depending on the recognized breeds and observers' perspectives. Despite anecdotal misinformation and incorrect visual identification, dog owners, animal shelters, veterinarians and the general public routinely use the term \"pit bull\" in casual and official papers as though it denotes a single, recognized breed.:\u200a197\u2013202\u200a,Bulldogs of the 1800s were described as having a \"round head, short nose, small ears and wide, muscular frame and legs.\" Their temperament has been described as being more aggressive and ferocious than other dogs of the time. It is believed their ancestors may have been mastiffs of Asian descent because of their aggressive tendencies and strength, but the term \"mastiff\" was used as a general reference for large dogs. Whether or not they were crossed with Pugs to make them better at bull baiting remains controversial.It is assumed that bull and terrier hybrids were crossed with several varieties of bulldogs and terriers, the types of which depended on location. A 2016 genetic assessment verified that bulldogs were descendants of mastiffs, but it also discovered pugs in the cross. The assessment, which analyzed a particular group of individual English bulldogs, used DNA rather than pedigrees to confirm that genetic diversity actually still exists. It further confirmed a substantial loss of genetic diversity in the breed resulting from a small founder population of about 68 individuals. The impact of focused selection for breeding dogs with specific physical traits created artificial genetic bottlenecks.,In Ireland, they used the old Irish bulldog with different terriers and some insertion of hunting sighthound/terrier crosses. In England, there were several varieties such as the Walsall and the Cradley Heath types. Phil Drabble reported that among the various types of bull and terrier, the type from Cradley Heath was recognised as a separate breed to be named the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. In the 19th century, the Walsall type was carried by immigrants to the United States, where it served as an important component for the genetic basis of the American Pit Bull Terrier breed, through specimens such as the dog Lloyd's Pilot and the Colby bloodline, strongly combined with Irish strains. The anatomy of the bull and terrier is the result of selective breeding for the purpose of hunting, dog fighting and baiting." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c59a" }, "breed": "Chiribaya Dog", "origin": "Peru", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiribaya_Dog", "img": "Not available", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e66" }, "breed": "Chiribaya Dog", "contenido": "The Chiribaya Dog (Spanish: perro Chiribaya) or Peruvian Shepherd Dog (perro pastor Peruano) is an extinct pre-Columbian breed of dog from the southwest of Peru. It has been established that it was a  llama herding dog. The dogs were not only an important part of the social structure of the ancient Peruvians, but they received special treatment after death as well. The remains were 1,000 years old.The dog variety has been referred to in various Spanish-language documentaries under different terms, such as el perro pastor Chribaya ('the Chiribaya shepherd dog') and pastor Peruano ('Peruvian shepherd'), though the ancient Peruvians did not keep sheep. Its original name is unknown (it has been referred to more ambiguously by the term perro Peruano or perro del Per\u00fa ('Peruvian dog', 'dog of Peru'), but this has also been applied to an extant but ancient hairless variety, referred to in more detail as perro sin pelo del Per\u00fa, 'hairless dog of Peru', or the Peruvian Inca Orchid, a favorite in South American dog shows).,The dogs were found buried in cemeteries next to 42 human mummies of the Chiribaya culture that flourished on the Ilo District, Moquegua Region, on the southern coast of Peru, who seem to have buried their pets with all the honors of a faithful friend and co-worker. The finding is due to the research of anthropologist Sonia Guill\u00e9n, who specializes in the study of ancient mummies from prosperous pre-Columbian cultures from the Chachapoyas to the shores of Moquegua. The mummies date from the \"late middle\" period, c. 900 to 1350 CE.In the port area of Ilo is Mallqui Center (from the word for 'mummy' in the Quechua language), dedicated to research regarding Chiribaya culture. This society developed as a chiefdom. Their territory has a feature that is the dream of every archaeologist: its soil is extremely dry, and it contains large amounts of nitrates, which ensured the preservation of the physical remains of those who inhabited this place.,Sonia Guill\u00e9n argues that the tomb of a person reflects his or her social, political and religious position within their society. In the case of these dogs, the tombs suggest that, having completed a productive life within the Chiribaya civilization, they received good treatment, whether dead or alive.,Martha Meier Mir\u00f3 Quesada, a journalist, producer and documentary filmmaker and her team were able to record in pictures the findings and Sonia Guillen's investigations and in 2006 produced a documentary titled El Perro Pastor Chiribaya ('The Chiribaya Shepherd Dog').,Ermanno Maniero, president of the Kennel Club of Peru, and veterinary doctor Viviana Fern\u00e1ndez of the National University of San Marcos thoroughly examined the mummies found and determined that these dogs were short-legged, and were longer than they were tall; had an abundant variety of hair colors that could vary between yellow and red, some with dark spots on the back or head; had cropped ears and falls; and had feet like those of a hare, allowing the animal to move on sand or soil with less effort, a quality that perhaps was important in the Chiribayas' environment.The BBC reported even more features: The dog was small, had a long snout, was beige in color, with long fur and resembled a small Golden Retriever.,The Chiribayas developed a coastal economy, with the use of the fishing and other marine resources, but also engaged in agriculture, including intensive use of livestock. Textiles and petroglyphs realize the llama-focused livestock activity of Chiribaya people, which underlines the importance of the \"shepherd\" (herding) dog in their society. According to research conducted by geneticist Jane Wheeler, who worked in the middle valley of Ilo and studied the remains of the llamas and the alpacas in the region, the Chiribayas raised a type of llama that had the longest, finest hair, but it was ignored by the Spanish conquerors, who used these llamas as pack animals, causing their demise. \"Having so many llamas, the Chiribayas needed herding dogs. Then, they became co-workers with the people so that their death produced honor\", says Sonia Guill\u00e9n." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c59c" }, "breed": "Cumberland Sheepdog", "origin": null, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumberland_Sheepdog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Cumberland-sheepdog.jpg/220px-Cumberland-sheepdog.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e74" }, "breed": "Cumberland Sheepdog", "contenido": "The Cumberland sheepdog is an extinct dog breed related to the border collie and other old working collie types.

Gris de Saint-Louis (Grey Saint Louis Hound) is an extinct breed of dog which originated in Medieval times. Like the Chien de Saint-Hubert, it was a scent hound, and formed part of the royal packs of France, which were composed, from about 1250 till 1470, exclusively of hounds of this type. According to King Charles IX, (1550\u20131574) they supposedly were introduced to France through Saint Louis (i.e. King Louis IX, 1226\u20131270), who had encountered these hounds while a prisoner during the Crusades, and subsequently received some as a gift. Old writers on hunting liked to ascribe an ancient and remote origin to their hounds, and these were claimed to be originally from Tartary. They were large, and, even though they did not have such good noses, were preferred by the Kings to the St Huberts, which were said to be only of medium size.,Jacques du Fouilloux, in the 16th century, says they were common, and describes them as 'gris' (grey) on the back with forequarters and legs tan or red, some having near black hair on the back. They were roughhaired, and were ancestors of the  modern French rough-coated Griffon breeds. However the rough coats were not mentioned by Charles IX or du Fouilloux, and it has been suggested they were acquired later through interbreeding with indigenous French hounds.  They were headstrong, wide casting hounds, inclined to change or overshoot, but determined in their pursuit of a quarry to the death. However, by the nineteenth century, like the St Hubert, they had become virtually impossible to find, because of mixed breeding and the effect of the Revolution on French hunting.George Turberville translated du Fouilloux' book on hunting into English, and used the term 'Dun hound' to translate 'Chien-gris'. It is presumed he did not translate it literally as 'grey-hound' to avoid confusion. One finds the term 'dun hound' in some subsequent writing in English, suggesting that the kind also existed in Britain, and it has been supposed that these 'dun hounds' went into the make up of the Bloodhound, accounting for the 'badgering' of the hair in the saddles of some bloodhounds.  However, Turberville did not make it very clear that his book was a translation, and it is highly possible that people mistakenly believed his work was about English hunting. Early references to the dun hound may simply come from people relying, like Nicolas Cox, on Turberville, and it is quite possible that the dun hound was never a significant animal in British hunting.,List of extinct dog breeds" }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c59d" }, "breed": "Cur", "origin": "England", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cur", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Cur_dog%2C_A_general_history_of_quadrupeds.jpg/220px-Cur_dog%2C_A_general_history_of_quadrupeds.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e75" }, "breed": "Cur", "contenido": "The term cur is usually used to describe a mongrel dog, particularly of aggressive or unfriendly nature.

A cur was also a now extinct dog breed used by cattle drovers in England.,In England the cur, also called the drover's dog, was a distinct breed of dog used by cattle drovers; they are now extinct. The cur was described by Ralph Beilby and Thomas Bewick in their 1790 work A general history of quadrupeds, as well as by Sydenham Edwards in his 1800 Cynographia Britannica, as dogs principally used by drovers to drive cattle. Curs were described as heelers, nipping the heels of cattle to make them move and ducking below the subsequent kick, they were said to be common in England, particularly the North of England, but were virtually unknown in the rest of the United Kingdom.The cur was described as being larger, stronger and longer legged than shepherd's collies with shorter and smoother coats; in colour they were generally black, brindled or grizzled with a white neck and legs and occasionally a white face, they had some feathering on their legs and half-pricked ears. A defining characteristic of the cur was many were born with short, stumpy tails, which gave the appearance of their having been docked. Edwards described the breed's ancestry as likely a mixture of collie, lurcher, English Mastiff or Great Dane. Their character was described as cunning, clever, ever busy and restless; it was said they could differentiate their master's cattle from those of strangers and they would separate the strange cattle from their master's herds.It is uncertain when or why the breed became extinct, it likely disappeared in the mid-19th century. Some modern writers believe it was the cur, not the collie, that was crossed with the dingo to create the now-extinct Halls Heeler in Australia, making the cur an ancestor of both the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog, the latter inheriting the cur's bobtail.,In the United States, the term cur is also used to describe a distinctive type of short-haired dog that is used for both hunting and herding that was developed in the Southern United States. When describing these dogs, the term is actually an abbreviation of cur-tailed, as in a dog with a naturally occurring bobtail like that of the extinct English cur; many of the earlier examples of this type had a bobtail and some still do. A number of cur breeds have been standardised within the United States, some have been recognised by the United Kennel Club; these breeds include the Black Mouth Cur, the Blue Lacy, the Catahoula Leopard dog, the Mountain Cur, the Stephens Cur, the Treeing Cur, and the Treeing Tennessee Brindle.These versatile dogs are used in a number of roles: for herding livestock, as well as trailing and locating lost livestock in thick scrubland; and in hunting a variety of game, including squirrels, opossums, raccoons, feral pigs, cougars, and American black bears, locating game both by sight and scent. While distinctive, American curs vary greatly in size; the various breeds and strains can be from 12 to 25 inches (30 to 64 cm) in height, and 40 to 95 pounds (18 to 43 kg) in weight.,List of extinct dog breeds" }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c59e" }, "breed": "Dalbo dog", "origin": "Sweden", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalbo_dog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Dalbohund.jpg/220px-Dalbohund.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e7e" }, "breed": "Dalbo dog", "contenido": "The Dalbo dog (Dalbohund) or Dalsland Mastiff is an extinct livestock guardian dog breed from Sweden.,From the Icelandic Sagas, there are indications to suggest that the Vikings had acquired large cattle/guard/war dogs from their invasion of Britain.

From the long-extant white-bodied working terriers came the Fox terrier, the Jack Russell terrier, the Parson Russell terrier, and the Sealyham terrier.,In the rush to create and claim new breeds, competing groups of dog breeders sometimes came up with different names for the same dog, and it was very common for entirely fictional breed histories to be cobbled up as part of a campaign to declare a new breed and create a bit of personal distinction for a dog's originator (to say nothing of sales).,In the 1860s and 1870s, a small group of dog show enthusiasts tried to claim that prick-eared versions of white working terriers were an entirely different breed from those same dogs with dropped ears. The problems with this claim were legion, however. For one thing, prick and drop-eared dogs were often found in the same litter, while entirely white dogs had a propensity for deafness and were therefore nearly useless in the field. (Briggs, 1894),In 1894, Rawdon Briggs Lee wondered, in his book Modern Dogs, about the relatively recent origin of the \"English White Terrier\" and noted that, \"It has been surmised that the original English White Terrier had been a fox terrier crossed with a white Italian greyhound\" (i.e. a toy breed).,Lee noted that at the London dogs shows where the breed first appeared in 1863\u20131864, the dogs were presented in two classes: \"one being for dogs and bitches under six or seven pounds weight, as the case may be; the other for dogs and bitches over that standard.\",In 1894, about the time that English White Terriers finally disappeared from the Kennel Club scene (it was always a pet and show dog, and never a working dog), Lee noted that \"The most recent London-bred specimens I have seen have been comparative toys, under 10lb. in weight, and with a rounded skull, or so-called 'apple head,\" which so persists in making its appearance in lilliputian specimens of the dog \u2013 an effect of inbreeding.\",Though Lee included a club description of the dog claiming the dog could be found as heavy as 20 lbs in weight, Lee (a noted Kennel Club judge and Kennel Editor of The Field sport hunting magazine) took the trouble to note that \"As a matter of fact, I do not ever remember seeing a really so-called pure English White Terrier up to 20 lbs, the maximum allowed by the club.\",Lee describes the English White Terrier as \"the most fragile and delicate of all our terriers,\" noting that \"he is not a sportsman's companion,\" but that he \"makes a nice house dog\" but \"requires a considerable amount of cuddling and care.\",Lee notes that at some of the early dog shows \"some of the specimens were shaped more like an Italian greyhound than as a terrier\" and that the dog \"is particularly subject to total or partial deafness.\"" }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5af" }, "breed": "Old Spanish Pointer", "origin": "Spain", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Spanish_Pointer", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Spanish_Pointer_from_1915.JPG/220px-Spanish_Pointer_from_1915.JPG", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f44" }, "breed": "Old Spanish Pointer", "contenido": "The Old Spanish Pointer, or Perro de Punta Espa\u00f1ol, is an extinct breed (or landrace) of dog originating in Spain, believed to be the ultimate ancestor of almost all pointing dogs.,In 1644, Alonso Mart\u00ednez de Espinar described the forerunner of the modern pointers as \"a very hard-working animal, with an inexhaustible agility which endures running from morning to night without stopping.

Broadly, it was a Scottish term for what in England was called the Bloodhound, although it seems that there were slight differences between them. It was also referred to as a 'slough dog', (or 'slewe dogge'), and a 'slow hound', the first word probably representing a mispronunciation of 'slough' rather than a reference to the speed of the hound.,The sleuth hound first appears in poems about the Scottish patriots Robert the Bruce and William Wallace. These poems depict their heroes tracked by sleuth hounds. Bruce escapes by crossing water, and Wallace by killing one of his party, whom he suspects of treachery, and leaving the corpse to distract the hound. The poems are romances, not histories, but there is no implausibility about the use of sleuth hounds. John Barbour, who wrote The Bruce, was born before his hero died, and the year in which the Bruce was supposedly pursued was 1307. Thus, the inclusion of the sleuth hound in the story was no anachronism, hence that the dogs existed in Scotland as early as c.\u20091300, and that their use as man-trailers was fully established.,The earliest description of the sleuth hound is in The history and croniklis of Scotland 1536, a translation by John Bellenden of a Latin text by Hector Boece, Historia Gentis Scotorum (History of the Scottish People), originally published in 1526.  The sleuth hound is described as one of three kinds of dog unique to Scotland. It is said to be red or black with small spots. Its special quality is its marvelous scenting power and determination in pursuing thieves (known as Border Reivers). The law of the borders between Scotland and England required that he who denies entry to the sleuth hound when in pursuit of stolen goods is held as an accomplice to the theft. ,John Caius (translated from Latin by Fleming 1576) describes very similar uses of the English bloodhound on the borders, leading us to think that the Bloodhound and sleuth hound were the same animal. In a book published in Switzerland in 1554 the sleuth hound is also called 'bl\u00fcthund' and 'canis Scoticus furum deprehensor' ('Scottish dog, thief catcher'). It is confirmed here and in other texts of the time that the two animals were the same, except that the Bloodhound was somewhat larger, and had a greater variety of coat colours than the sleuth hound. Generally, references to the sleuth hound appear in a man-trailing context, whereas the Bloodhound may appear either as a man-trailer or as a seeker of beasts in the hunting field.,Probably from around 1700, any differences between the two types disappeared. \"Bloodhound\" becomes the usual term even in Scottish sources, such as Sir Walter Scott. The Scottish term survives in its metaphorical use from the beginning of the 19th century as a detective, now usually shortened to sleuth.,OF THE MERUELLUS NATURE OF SYNDRY SCOTTIS DOGGIS,In Scotland ar doggis of meruellous nature, For abone the commoun nature and condition of doggis, quhilkis ar sene in al partis, ar thre maner of doggis in Scotland, quhilk ar sene in na vthir partis of the warld....

The third kind is larger than any pack-hound, red coloured or else black with small streaks of spots, and they are called sleuth-hounds by the people. These dogs have such a marvellous cleverness that they seek for thieves, and follow them only by the scent of the goods that are taken away. And not only find the thief but attack him with great cruelty. And though the thieves often cross the water, where they pass to make the hound lose the scent of them and the goods, yet he searches here and there with such diligence that by his foot (ie by the foot-scent of the thief) he finds both the trace of the thief and his goods. The marvellous nature of these hounds will not be believed by ignorant people. Nevertheless, the same hounds are very frequent and common on the borders of England and Scotland. In addition it is established by the laws of the border that he that denies entry to the sleuth-hound on an occasion of pursuit and searching for goods shall be held as an accomplice to the crime and theft committed.,Bellenden's translation says that the sleuth hound is larger than a rache (pack hound); Boece's Latin original says it is not larger.

It is best known for being involved in the early development of the modern Curly Coated Retriever and Golden Retriever breeds of dogs. They were described as generally brown, athletic dogs from the area around Berwick-upon-Tweed near the River Tweed and close to the Scottish Borders. A type of water dog, the breed was not well known outside the local area. This breed may have been created by crossing local water dogs with imported St. John's water dog, another breed which is also now extinct.,The village of Norham, Northumberland, just south of the River Tweed was noted as being \"long famous\" for a breed of water spaniel of which were \"invariably brown\".In 1816, Richard Lawrence wrote of the origins of the Tweed Water Spaniel, \"Along rocky shores and dreadful declivities beyond the junction of the Tweed with the sea of Berwick, water dogs have derived an addition of strength, from the introduction of a cross with the Newfoundland dog, which has rendered them completely adequate to the arduous difficulties and diurnal perils in which they are systematically engaged.\" Although the quote refers specifically to the Newfoundland breed, it is actually more likely to mean the now extinct breed of the St. John's water dog which was sometimes referred to by its homeland's location of Newfoundland and Labrador.Stanley O'Neil, an expert in Flat-coated Retrievers, wrote of the Tweed Water Spaniel in a letter during the late 19th century, \"Further up the coast, probably Alnmouth, I saw men netting for salmon. With them was a dog with a wavy or curly coat. It was a tawny colour but, wet and spumy, it was difficult to see the exact colour, or how much was due to bleach and salt. Whilst my elders discussed the fishing I asked these Northumberland salmon net men whether their dog was a Water-Dog or a Curly, airing my knowledge. They told me he was a Tweed Water Spaniel. This was a new one on me. I had a nasty suspicion my leg was being pulled. This dog looked like a brown Water Dog to me, certainly retrieverish, and not at all spanielly. I asked if he came from a trawler, and was told it came from Berwick.\"Linda P. Case, of the University of Illinois, speculated the Tweed Water Spaniel was so named because it was developed on the estate of Lord Tweedmouth, and in fact was simply the original name for a breed of dog that later became the Golden Retriever. However, this theory is against the documented evidence, as the early development of the Golden Retriever was fully documented and listed the three Tweed Water Spaniels involved specifically by breed.,The Tweed Water Spaniel had a long tail and a curly, liver-colored coat, and looked similar to the Irish Water Spaniel except  it had a heavier muzzle and a pointed skull. The dog also had thick, slightly feathered, hound-like ears, droopy lips, and fore legs that were feathered, but hind legs that were not. Their size was that of a small retriever, with a liver-coloured curly coat. Instances of offspring which were liver-coloured but tan below the knees were noted in Hugh Dalziel's 1897 work British Dogs: Their Varieties, History, Characteristics, Breeding, Management, And Exhibition, although the author speculated this may have been due to Bloodhound ancestry in one of the parents of the litters.The breed was known for its intelligence, courage, and sporting ability." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5bf" }, "breed": "Welsh Hillman", "origin": "Wales", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Hillman", "img": "Not available", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ff7" }, "breed": "Welsh Hillman", "contenido": "The Welsh Hillman was an ancient landrace or type of herding dog in Wales, used for herding and droving.

Although it is often referred to as the Brittany Spaniel, they are not actually spaniels. The AKC reclassified them in 1984 as just Brittanys, since they are pointing dogs and have less genetically in common with Spaniels, and more in common with Setters, which are pointing dogs.  The breed's working characteristics are more akin to those of a pointer or setter than a spaniel. Brittanys were developed in Brittany, a province in northwest France, between the 17th and 19th centuries, becoming officially recognized early in the 20th.  There are French Brittanys as well as American Brittanys. French Brittanys are used for upland birds and rabbits, whereas the American Brittanys are used for upland birds hunting exclusively.,The name \"Brittany\" is taken from the Brittany region in northwestern France where the dog originated. Images of orange and white Brittany-like dogs hunting and retrieving game were first seen on tapestries and paintings from the 17th century. The first written and verifiable record of Brittanys comes from a hunting description written by Reverend Davies in 1850. He described hunting with small \"bobtailed\" dogs who pointed and were excellent retrievers. It was around the same time that the modern Brittany is rumored to have been bred by mating with English Setters.The Brittany was first recognized as a breed in 1907 when an orange and white male named Boy was registered in France. As a result, the first standards were outlined in the same year. America recognized the Brittany in 1931 and the breed was approved by the American Kennel Club in 1934. In 1982 the \"Spaniel\" was officially dropped from the name.,The Brittany is typically quite athletic, compact, energetic, and solidly built without being heavy.  Their heads are of average size with floppy ears, expressions usually of intelligence, vigour, and alertness, and gait elastic, long, and free.,Most Brittanys are born with long tails docked to a length of 3\u201310 centimetres (1.2\u20133.9 in)Yet sometimes they are born with short tails.,The breed's coat color is varied: orange and white coat or liver and white are most common in the American Brittany; other colors include orange roan and liver roan, all of which are acceptable in the show ring. The American Brittany Standard specifies an acceptable tri-color of liver, orange, and white with very specific color placement.

It has been employed as a guard dog in the homes of the wealthy. The breed's numbers dwindled severely during World War II, but the dog made a successful return in the 1970s.,The Danish Broholmer is a dog that strongly resembles a Mastiff. It is large and powerful, with a loud, impressive bark and dominant walk.,A well trained Broholmer should be calm, good tempered, and friendly, yet watchful towards strangers. Females stand about 27.5 inches (70 cm) and weigh in at 90\u2013130 pounds (41\u201359 kg).  Males stand about 29.5 inches (75 cm) and weigh in at 110\u2013150 pounds (50\u201368 kg). The body is built square and rectangular with a large and massive head. The width and length of the skull and the length of the nose should be of equal length. The head is generally not carried very high. The coat is short and harsh, and the color can be light or brownish yellow, or black. Some white markings on the coat are permitted, and a black mask may be found.  The average life span is around 7\u201312 years.,The Broholmer breed was generated from a cross between English Mastiffs and local dogs in Germany, and was named after Sehested of Broholm, a game-keeper who lived in the 18th century. During the Second World War, the Broholmer became a victim of the strife and almost became extinct, but was saved by a group of Danish enthusiasts after isolated members were found in the 1970s. King Frederick VII and his consort, Countess Danner were owners of several Broholmers and one of their portraits depicts them with one of their dogs.  The breed was established in the early 19th century and was moderately popular, especially as a guard dog in the homes of wealthy Danes. The Breed was imported to the UK in 2009 with a view to being put on the UK kennel clubs import list.  ,It was discovered in the recent years (2016) that the Broholmers that were imported into the USA were all afflicted with Degenerative Myelopathy (DM), a spontaneously occurring, adult-onset spinal cord disorder that affects dogs, and is similar to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's disease in humans (1). With DM, there is degeneration of the \u201cwhite matter\u201d of the spinal cord and the peripheral nerves. The white matter tracts of the spinal cord contain fibers that transmit movement commands from the brain to the limbs and sensory information from the limbs to the brain.  The first Broholmer ever to be imported into the United States with the intent to breed it, died in 2018 due to DM, and all other dogs imported have DM as well. These dogs were never presented and therefore never accepted by Broholmer Selskabet, the Danish main organization for the protection and the breeding of healthy Broholmers. One completely healthy male Broholmer, Bodholdts Bedste Bergthor, approved for breeding by the Broholmer Selskab, was imported into the US in 2010.

It was developed as a guard dog in the nineteenth century by cross-breeding the English Mastiff with the now-extinct Old English Bulldog. It was recognised as a breed by The Kennel Club in 1924.,The origins of the Bullmastiff are unclear. In the nineteenth century, in some regions of England, the Old English Mastiff and English Bulldog were commonly inter-bred to produce dogs suitable for work guarding people and their property. By the beginning of the twentieth century this cross-breed was in widespread use as an aid to gamekeepers in the control of poaching. They were bred by gamekeepers for strength, size and speed using a cross of the tough, heavy and aggressive Bulldog of the nineteenth century with the large, strong, less aggressive Mastiff. As a result, the Bullmastiff is known as the Gamekeeper's Night Dog.,The Bullmastiff was recognised as a breed by The Kennel Club in 1924. Dogs had to have a minimum of four generations of descent from Bullmastiff stock without input from either Bulldog or Mastiff; cross-bred animals could not be registered. The American Kennel Club recognised it in 1934. It was definitively accepted by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 1955.In 1928, the diamond mining company De Beers imported Bullmastiffs to South Africa to guard the mines.,  ,The Bullmastiff is a large dog.

It is one of the oldest breeds of the British Isles. Cardigan Welsh Corgis are known to be an extremely loyal dog breed. They are also versatile and can live in a variety of settings.,Pembroke and Cardigan Welsh Corgis were originally listed as one breed by The Kennel Club in Britain in 1925, but were declared separate breeds in 1935. The Corgi Club was founded in December 1925 in Carmarthen in South Wales. It is reported that the local members favored the Pembroke breed, so a club for Cardigan enthusiasts was founded a year later (1926). Both groups have worked hard to ensure the appearance and type of breed are standardized through careful selective breeding. Pembrokes and Cardigans were officially recognized by the Kennel Club in 1928 and were lumped together under the heading Welsh Corgis. In 1934, the two breeds were recognized individually and shown separately.,One theory is that both breeds of the corgis descended from a line of northern spitz-type dogs. Another is that they descended from the Teckel family of dogs, which also produced Dachshunds.The word \"corgi\" is derived from the Welsh: cor gi, which means \"dwarf dog\". The breed was formerly called \"yard-long dog\" (Welsh: ci-llathed). Today's name comes from their area of origin: Cardigan (Welsh 'Ceredigion').,The Cardigan is a long, low dog with upright ears and a fox brush tail.Originally used only as a farm guardian, they eventually took on the traits of a cattle drover, herder, and many more. They are still highly valued for their herding, working, and guarding skills, as well as their companionship.  The old American Kennel Club standard called it an \"Alsatian on short legs\". The Cardigan's tail is long (unlike the Pembroke Welsh Corgi, whose tail may be long, naturally bobbed or docked).,Cardigans, which are double coated,  come in a variety of colors including any shade of red, sable, or brindle, as well as black, with or without tan, brindle or blue merle, with or without tan or brindle points. Other unofficial colors can occur, such as red merle, but these colors are not considered acceptable per the Cardigan standard. They usually have white on the neck, chest, legs, muzzle, underneath, tip of the tail and as a blaze on the head, known as the \"Irish pattern.\" Other markings include ticking on the legs and muzzle, smutty muzzles and monk's hoods, especially on sables (a pattern of darker tipped hairs over a basic red coat color.).  An average Cardigan is around 10 to 13 inches (250 to 330 mm) tall at the withers and weighs from 30 to 38 pounds (14 to 17 kg) for the male and 25 to 34 pounds (11 to 15 kg) for the female.Life expectancy is 12\u201316 years.

Efforts to establish them as a standardized breed has gained the Carolina Dog breed recognition in two smaller kennel clubs and full acceptance into the breed-establishment program of one major kennel club.,Originally a landrace breed, the Carolina dog was rediscovered living as free-roaming population by I. Lehr Brisbin Jr., though originally documented in American dog-related publications in the 1920s. Carolina dogs show admixture with dog breeds from east Asia.,One of the earliest publications to document the \"Indian\" dogs of North America was an article by [Glover Morrill Allen], in 1920. Allen postulated that these \"Larger or Common Indian Dogs\" were descended from Asian primitive dogs: The probability therefore is, that the Domestic Dog originated in Asia and was carried by ancient peoples both east and west into all parts of the inhabited world. That this migration began in late Pleistocene times seems highly probable. Allen cites late nineteenth-century studies of skeletal remains of dogs that could be found from Alaska to Florida to the Greater Antilles and westward to the Great Plains, and were excavated from Indian (chinese) mounds as well:,Cope (1893) was the first to describe the jaw of this dog from a specimen collected by Moore from a shell-mound on St. John's River, Florida. He was struck by the fact that the first lower premolar was missing and appeared not to have developed. He also noticed strong development of the entoconid of the carnassial.,Moore, in the course of various explorations in Florida and Georgia discovered many remains of dogs, apparently of this type. In a large mound on Ossabaw Island, Georgia, he (1897) found several interments of human and dog-skeletons, the latter always buried separately and entire, showing that the dogs had not been used as food. Other dog-skeletons of a similar sort were found by Moore (1899) in aboriginal mounds on the South Carolina coast ... Putnam considered them the same as the larger Madisonville (Ohio) dogs.,These dogs were publicized by I. Lehr Brisbin Jr., a senior research ecologist at the University of Georgia's Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, who first came across a Carolina dog while working at the Savannah River Site, which was depopulated and secured of all trespass and traffic for decades beginning in 1950.,Since 1996, Carolina dogs can be registered with the United Kennel Club (UKC), which has published a detailed, formal Carolina Dog breed standard. UKC focuses on hunting dogs and other working dogs, and categorizes the Carolina in their \"Sighthound & Pariah Group\", along with other breeds such as the Basenji of Africa and the Thai Ridgeback. A breed standard has also been issued by the American Rare Breed Association (ARBA). ARBA includes the Carolina in their Group 5 along with the Canaan dog and the New Guinea singing dog.In July 2017, the American Kennel Club (AKC, the largest dog breed registry in the United States) accepted the Carolina Dog breeding program into its Foundation Stock Service (FSS), the first step toward official AKC breed recognition.

The breed was developed in the United States Chesapeake Bay area during the 19th century. Historically used by area market hunters to retrieve waterfowl, pull fishing nets, and rescue fishermen, it is today primarily a family pet and hunting companion. They are often known for their love of water and their ability to hunt.  It is a medium to large sized dog similar in appearance to the Labrador Retriever. The Chesapeake has a wavy coat, rather than the Labrador's smooth coat. They are described as having a bright and happy disposition, courage, willingness to work, alertness, intelligence, and love of water as some of their characteristics.,Distinctive features include eyes that are very clear, of yellowish or amber hue, hindquarters as high or a trifle higher than the shoulders, and a double-coat that tends to wave on shoulders, neck, back, and loins. The waterproof coat feels slightly oily and is often associated with a slight musky odor. Three basic colors are generally seen in the breed: brown, which includes all shades from a light to a deep dark brown; sedge, which varies from a reddish yellow through a bright red to chestnut shades; and deadgrass in all its shades, varying from a faded tan to a dull straw color. The breed standard states that white may also appear but it must be limited to the breast, belly, toes, or back of the feet. The head is round and broad with a medium stop and muzzle. The lips are thin, and the ears are small and of medium leather. The forelegs should be straight with good bone. The hindquarters are especially strong and the toes webbed since excellent swimming ability is important for the Chesapeake. This breed is also known for its large and powerful chest, used to break apart ice when diving into cold water while duck hunting.,The coat of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever is given the most consideration of any trait listed on the Positive Scale of Points in the Breed Standard. However the AKC Standard also reads \"The question of coat and general type of balance takes precedence over any scoring table which could be drawn up. The Chesapeake should be well proportioned, an animal with a good coat and well balanced in other points being preferable to one excelling in some but weak in others.\" The hair on the face and legs should be very short and straight with a tendency to wave, never curl, on the shoulders, neck, back, and loins only and nowhere over 1.5 inches long. Moderate feathering on the rear of the hindquarters and tail is permissible although not longer than 1.75 inches long.,The texture of the thick double-coat is important in protecting the dog from cold water and icy conditions. The oil in the harsh outer coat and woolly undercoat resists water, keeping the dog dry and warm. Maintenance of the coat is minimal and mainly consists of brushing with a short-tooth brush once a week. It is difficult to get a Chesapeake Bay Retriever thoroughly wet, but they should be bathed every 3\u20134 months using a suitably mild shampoo, then dried thoroughly. Brushing or bathing more often can ruin the texture since it strips the protective oil from the coat and may even remove the undercoat.  The color of the coat must be similar to the working surroundings. Any color of brown, sedge or deadgrass is acceptable and one color is not preferred over another. The American Chesapeake Club includes a discussion on color:,Three basic colors are generally seen in the breed: Brown which includes all shades from a light cocoa (a silvered brown) to a deep bittersweet chocolate color; sedge which varies from a reddish yellow through a bright red to chestnut shades; deadgrass which takes in all shades of deadgrass, varying from a faded tan to a dull straw color. Historic records show that some of the deadgrass shades can be very light, almost white in appearance, while darker deadgrass colors can include diluted shades of brown called ash, that appear as either gray or taupe. The almost white and ash/taupe/gray shades are not commonly seen, but are acceptable.The difference between a sedge and a deadgrass is that the deadgrass shades contain no significant amount of red, while the sedge shades do have red. Coat and texture also play a factor in the perception of color. The self-color pattern is preferred by the standard (One color with or without lighter and darker shadings of the same color). You will see dogs with varying degrees of other markings such as: masking on top of the skull, striping effect of light & dark through the body and on legs, distinct & indistinct saddle markings, agouti coloring and tan points. All are acceptable, they are just not preferred.A white spot on the breast (not extending above the sternum), belly, toes or back of the feet is permissible, but the smaller the spot the better.

The Drever is descended from the Westphalian Dachsbracke, a type of German hound called Bracke. The breed name Drever was chosen through a contest in 1947.,The Drever's most noticeable characteristics are its long body and short legs, inherited from the Westphalian Dachsbracke, but as a working dog these features are not exaggerated. It has short fur, and is of any color with white markings (but not all white, which has been linked to deafness.) The breed has the typical drop (hanging) ears of a hound, and a long tail. The maximum height of a Drever is 38 cm (15 ins) at the withers, which is about 15 cm (approx. 6 ins) shorter than a long legged hunting hound with the same size body. The Westphalian Dachsbracke is about 2 cm (less than an inch) shorter than the Drever.,Most breeds with similar physical traits are bred for a single purpose, but the Drever has been bred to hunt all sizes of game, both hares and roe deer, and is also used to hunt fox and red deer. The Drever has a lot of stamina, and has become a popular hunting hound for deer hunters in northern Norway, Sweden, and Finland as a change in legislation allowed the use of drevers in deer hunting. Roe deer are nervous quarry, and the hounds which are used to hunt them must move slowly, especially in areas where heavy snow can be expected in late autumn.  This is given as the reason for breeding of a dog with a medium-sized body but short legs.,The Drever in Sweden is usually kept as a hunting hound and is not usually found as a pet.,The Drever is a Swedish breed originating with the Westphalian Dachsbracke (a small hound for tracking deer), brought from Germany to Sweden around 1910,  and crossbred with other hounds to adjust \"to Swedish terrain and game.\" By the 1940s there were two distinctive sizes of the Dachsbracke, and a newspaper contest was held in 1947 to choose the new name for the slightly larger variety; Drever was chosen, from the Swedish word drev, referring to a type of hunt where the dogs drive the game towards the hunter. The Drever was then recognised by the Swedish Kennel Club as a separate breed in 1947. The breed is recognised internationally by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, in Group 6 Scenthounds and related breeds, Section 1.3, Small-sized Hounds.The Drever  was recognized by the Canadian Kennel Club in 1956 in the Hound Group,  and in 1996 by the United Kennel Club in its Scenthound Group. The breed is also recognized by a long list of minor registries, rare breed groups, hunting clubs, and internet registry businesses, and is promoted in North America as a rare breed pet. It is not currently recognized by The Kennel Club (UK), the Australian National Kennel Council or the New Zealand Kennel Club, or the American Kennel Club." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5ef" }, "breed": "Dutch Shepherd", "origin": "Netherlands", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Shepherd", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Short-haired_Dutch_Shepherd%C2%A9CaroleField.jpg/220px-Short-haired_Dutch_Shepherd%C2%A9CaroleField.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c738" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/dutch_shepherd.jpg", "good_with_children": 3, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 2, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 3, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 5, "trainability": 5, "energy": 5, "barking": 2, "min_life_expectancy": 11, "max_life_expectancy": 14, "max_height_male": 24.5, "max_height_female": 24.5, "max_weight_male": 75, "max_weight_female": 75, "min_height_male": 21.5, "min_height_female": 21.5, "min_weight_male": 42, "min_weight_female": 42, "breed": "Dutch Shepherd" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e90" }, "breed": "Dutch Shepherd", "contenido": "The Dutch Shepherd is a herding dog of Dutch origin. They were used by shepherds and farmers who needed a versatile dog, with few demands, and a dog that was able to adapt to a harsh and meager existence.,The Dutch Shepherd was discovered as a naturally occurring shepherd's dog type living in the rural parts of the historic region of the Netherlands (which includes the modern-day Kingdom of the Netherlands). When the first breed standard was written in 1898, the coat could be any colour, but in 1914, it was decided to allow only brindle to distinguish the breed from the then-similar German Shepherd and Belgian Shepherds. The breeds eventually diverged into the six distinct breeds as they are known today. However, the Dutch Shepherd remains nearly the same dog it was more than 100 years ago; it is distinguished from the Belgian Shepherds and German Shepherd by the details specified in the breed standard, primarily of the head.,Originally, the main function of the Dutch Shepherd was that of a shepherd's dog in the countryside. From early times, the Dutch had an arable culture that was maintained by flocks of sheep. The dogs had to keep the flock away, and STAY the flock away from the crops, which they did by patrolling the borders of the roads and fields. They also accompanied the flocks on their way to the common meadows, markets, and ports.At the farm, they kept the hens away from the kitchen garden, herded the cows together for milking, and pulled the milk carts. They also alerted the farmers when strangers entered the farmyard. Around 1900, sheep flocks had, for the greater part, disappeared in the Netherlands. The versatile skills of the Dutch Shepherds made them suitable for dog training, which was then starting to become popular. They were then trained and used as police dogs, search and tracking dogs, and guide dogs for the blind. They are, however, still capable of herding sheep." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5f2" }, "breed": "Estrela Mountain Dog", "origin": "Portugal", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrela_Mountain_Dog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Estrela_Mountain_Dog_6_month_old_male.jpg/220px-Estrela_Mountain_Dog_6_month_old_male.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c73a" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/estrela_mountain_dog.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 4, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 2, "playfulness": 3, "protectiveness": 5, "trainability": 4, "energy": 3, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 10, "max_life_expectancy": 14, "max_height_male": 29, "max_height_female": 29, "max_weight_male": 132, "max_weight_female": 132, "min_height_male": 24.5, "min_height_female": 24.5, "min_weight_male": 77, "min_weight_female": 77, "breed": "Estrela Mountain Dog" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ea0" }, "breed": "Estrela Mountain Dog", "contenido": "The Estrela Mountain Dog  (Portuguese: c\u00e3o da Serra da Estrela) is a large breed of dog from the Estrela Mountains of Portugal bred to guard herds and homesteads.

Thought to be ancient in origin, the Greek Shepherd is very closely related to livestock guardian dog breeds from neighbouring countries; it is believed that some dogs are simultaneously claimed to be other breeds as they migrate annually across national borders with the flocks they protect in search seasonal pastures.,It is believed livestock guardian dogs are one of the oldest distinct dog types, with evidence the type has remained largely unchanged since ancient times. It is claimed the Greek Shepherd has been found in Greece since ancient times, Plato wrote of dogs of similar form and function being known in the region of Epirus as early as 800 BC. The Greek Shepherd is known as the Ellinik\u00f3s Pimenik\u00f3s (\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03a0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2) in Greek, it has been called the Greek Shepherd Dog, the Greek Sheepdog and the Hellenic Shepherd Dog. The breed is found throughout Greece, particularly in the north of the country; it is very closely related to other livestock guardian breeds found throughout the Balkans.Many Balkan shepherds and their flocks undertake an annual migration between Greece and the \u0160ar Mountains to capitalise on summer mountain pastures but avoid the harsh snow-covered mountain winters when no feed is available, in 1977 it was estimated over 500,000 sheep made this annual migration. Because these same dogs can be seen in multiple countries at different times of the years, some cynologists including Raymond Coppinger observe that many dogs claimed to be Greek Shepherd are in fact also claimed to be \u0160arplaninacs and other regional breeds; and that nationalistic kennel clubs have given separate identities and breed standards to the very same dogs, differing appearances being due to changing appearance of these dogs as they gain their heavier winter coats and shed them again for the heat of the summer. Typically these shepherds winter their flocks in Greece where their Greek Shepherds protect the flocks from Greek wolves and jackals; then as the weather improves they walk with their flocks, accompanied by their dogs, over 480 kilometres (300 mi) through North Macedonia to their summer pastures in the \u0160ar Mountains on the border of Albania and Kosovo where their \u0160arplaninacs protect their flocks from predators found there; then in the autumn they make the return journey to Greece where their dogs once again transform into Greek Shepherds.,The Greek Shepherd is a large breed of dog that closely resembles the Italian Maremmano-Abruzzese Sheepdog, the Hungarian Kuvasz and the Polish Tatra Shepherd Dog; the breed displays the traits common to most livestock guardian dog breeds, including a thick weatherproof double-coat and a powerful build. The Kennel Club of Greece's breed standard states dogs should stand over 66 centimetres (26 in) at the withers and that they can stand as much as 70 to 75 centimetres (28 to 30 in) tall; and that bitches should be over 60 centimetres (24 in) tall but can attain heights of 65 to 68 centimetres (26 to 27 in). The breed standard states dogs should weigh between 40 and 55 kilograms (88 and 121 lb) and bitches between 32 and 40 kilograms (71 and 88 lb).The breed has a dense double-coat; it has never been bred for colour and can be found in a broad range of colours, including white, black, brown, light-brown or a combination of these, with spotted examples being common. In some areas, only pure white examples are kept by local shepherds, with non-white puppies being culled because it is thought they bring bad luck.In former times, many Greek shepherds would crop the right ear of their dogs, believing doing so improved the dogs' hearing; this practice gave the dogs a curious, lopsided appearance." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c605" }, "breed": "Montenegrin Mountain Hound", "origin": "Montenegro", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegrin_Mountain_Hound", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Montenegrin_Mountain_Hound_2.jpg/220px-Montenegrin_Mountain_Hound_2.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f2a" }, "breed": "Montenegrin Mountain Hound", "contenido": "The Montenegrin Mountain Hound (Serbo-Croatian: crnogorski planinski goni\u010d / \u0446\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0433\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0447) is a rare dog breed from the mountain regions across the Balkans.

There has been a long informal debate over whether this type of dog is a spitz or miniature sheepdog. In their home country of Belgium they are considered a small shepherd. DNA research has shown that Schipperkes have a close relationship to the Spitz family of dog breeds.,The Schipperke is a small, sturdy, usually black dog in the Spitz family. Their pointed ears are erect atop the head. Schipperkes are double coated with a soft, fluffy undercoat that is covered by a somewhat harsher-feeling and longer outer coat. One of the breed characteristics is a long ruff that surrounds the neck and then a strip trails down towards the rear of the dog.  They also have longer fur on their hind legs called culottes. The breed is usually black, but sometimes blonde or cream colored (some blondes have a silkier coat), very rarely they can have a liver-red coloration. And the coat is shiny. Dogs of this breed usually weigh 3\u20139 kg (6.6\u201319.8 lb).,In Canada and the United States, the tail is usually docked (cut off) the day after birth. In countries that have bans on docking, adult Schipperkes often have Spitz-like and often up-curled, spiraled, long-haired tails can which occasionally vary in type. There have been animal cruelty complaints about the practice of docking. This includes the fact that dogs often express emotions and various behavioral modes with their tails. It is not known how this loss of behavioral and emotional expression affects the animal.,Owners of undocked adult Schipperke have often commented that the spiral curled, long-haired tails of the dog are quite attractive and that the practice of removing them makes the breed less appealing to the eye. Puppies are born with tails in different lengths. However, they are among those dogs with the rare natural bobtail C189G mutation.[4],Schipperkes are naturally curious and high-energy dogs and require much exercise. They are sometimes very active, running very fast and then breaking into quick, agile criss-cross patterns. However the same Schipperke can also rest for hours on end. So they are not constantly active, in contrast to the Jack Russell terrier. The Schipperke is Known for a stubborn, mischievous, and headstrong temperament, it also chases small animals. The Schipperke is sometimes referred to as the \"little black fox\", or the \"little black devil\". In Australia they are sometimes called the \"Tasmanian black devil.\" Schipperkes are very smart and independent; and sometimes debate listening to owners, instead choosing to do whatever benefits them the most, and are not necessarily the proper dog for a first-time dog owner. Schipperkes require training and a secure, fenced-in space in which to run. They must be leash-trained or they will often pull the leash as if they were a sled dog with no regard for the owner.This is easily correctable using training methods from a reliable source. Schipperkes are also escape prone and very fast so they require a leash or a fence at all times.Schipperkes are notorious around horses and should only be kept leashed when near them. Even if a horse is in full trot, a Schipperke may run at it and then and dart back and forth between its hoofs, narrowly avoiding being crushed and barking furiously all the while. The dogs are so agile and fast that they rarely get hurt, but the horse and rider, not to mention the owner can be surprised by this. Not all Schipperkes do this. Some are calm around large hoofed animals and may only give a couple of curious sniffs before turning away. Good training can also help.Schipperkes are formidable barkers and can be aggressive with other dogs if they are strangers. Yet they get along well with dogs whom they already know, especially dogs from their own household. They are known for challenging dogs they are unfamiliar with and can sometimes get into fights. Schipperkes are fearless and will, without reservation, go after a dog that is much larger than themselves. Sometimes this results in the Schipperke getting bitten, even badly so. Wounds and bites can be hidden by fur and can so go undetected until a dangerous infection sets in. A trip to the vet after a dogfight is therefore always required in order to find and stitch up any wounds and especially to provide antibiotics. The vet will often shave the fur off of a suspected area in order to find the real extent of bite holes or gashes that might need treatment. This is a good reason why keeping a Schipperke leased and fenced at all times is advisable. Schipperkes are very good with children and were once guard dogs so they make good family protectors. They have no fear of intruders, despite their small size and will bark aggressively, sounding an alarm. They can also harass an intruder by dancing in fast circles around their legs while barking. But they almost never bite humans.And when strangers are outside Schipperkes will bark to alert their owners. Schipperkes are often the first to alert the household because their hearing is better than that of humans. Consequently they make good guard dogs.Schipperkes are somewhat aloof but will readily accept affection from others. Despite being less affectionate themselves, they will sleep with their head in an owners lap, if there is a close relationship. They have also been known to rest their head in an owner's hand. This is more likely to happen when someone spends a lot of time with the dog. Schipperkes will also sleep in an owners bed although they rarely spend a whole night in one location, so they will usually be gone halfway through the night. If there is more than one Schipperke in a household they will often keep watch, lay and sleep together.Schipperkes are very aware of who is the dominant human in the home and they will display exclusive submissive affection towards them. Typically they will lie on their backs with their bellies exposed, their ears folded back, and if petted or stroked, will lick the dominant humans hand slowly. They will only do this for one person in the house and are keen observers of who is the strongest sounding human in the \"pack\". Schipperkes will however, become very excited and demonstrative towards anyone who grabs a leash as they know this means they will be going outside. They can sometimes have similar responses when someone is preparing food for them in their bowl. As aloof as they can be, they can become very excited and expressive in these situations.Schipperkes who live alone in a back yard can become problem barkers. One way to solve this is to get another Schipperke, so the first one will have a companion. This will tend to quiet them down. They do well in groups up to four and since they know each other, they will get along and even rest close to each other. If encouraged by the owner making a howling sound, they will howl together, but not very often on their own initiative and not for very long.The Schipperke has been described as a large dog in a small body.

The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.,It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion dog, and according to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations in 2013.,During the 1890s, attempts were being made to standardise dog breeds. Dogs were being bred to preserve traits that assisted in their job of herding sheep and protecting their flocks from predators. In Germany this was practised within local communities, where shepherds selected and bred dogs. It was recognised that the breed had the necessary skills for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen senses of smell. The results were dogs that were able to do such things, but that differed significantly, both in appearance and ability, from one locality to another.To combat these differences, the Phylax Society was formed in 1891 with the intention of creating standardised development plans for native dog breeds in Germany. The society disbanded after only three years due to ongoing internal conflicts regarding the traits in dogs that the society should promote; some members believed dogs should be bred solely for working purposes, while others believed dogs should be bred also for appearance. While unsuccessful in their goal, the Phylax Society had inspired people to pursue standardising dog breeds independently.,With the rise of large, industrialised cities in Germany, the predator population began to decline, rendering sheepdogs unnecessary. At the same time, the awareness of sheepdogs as a versatile, intelligent class of canine began to rise. Max von Stephanitz, an ex-cavalry captain and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was an ex-member of the Phylax Society who firmly believed dogs should be bred for working. He admired the intelligence, strength and ability of Germany's native sheepdogs, but could not find any one single breed that satisfied him as the perfect working dog.In 1899, von Stephanitz was attending a dog show when he was shown a dog named Hektor Linksrhein. Hektor was the product of few generations of selective breeding and completely fulfilled what von Stephanitz believed a working dog should be. He was pleased with the strength of the dog and was so taken by the animal's intelligence, loyalty, and beauty, that he purchased him immediately. After purchasing the dog he changed his name to Horand von Grafrath and von Stephanitz founded the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde (Society for German Shepherd Dogs). Horand was declared to be the first German Shepherd Dog, and was the first dog added to the society's breed register. In just a few decades of the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde's establishment, the breed became one of the world's most popular and numerous, a position it has maintained to this day. By 1923, the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde claimed 50,000 dues-paying members in more than 500 branches in Germany alone.Horand became the center-point of the breeding programs and was bred with dogs belonging to other society members that displayed desirable traits and with dogs from Thuringia, Franconia, and W\u00fcrttemberg. Fathering many pups, Horand's most prolific was Hektor von Schwaben. Hektor was inbred with another of Horand's offspring and produced Heinz von Starkenburg, Beowulf, and Pilot, who later sired a total of 84 pups, mostly through being inbred with Hektor's other offspring. This inbreeding was deemed necessary in order to fix the traits being sought in the breed. Beowulf's progeny also were inbred and it is from these pups that all German shepherds draw a genetic link. It is believed the society accomplished its goal mostly due to von Stephanitz's strong, uncompromising leadership and he is therefore credited with being the creator of the German Shepherd Dog.During the first half of the twentieth century, the breed came to be strongly identified with Imperial and Nazi Germany, because of its association with purity and militarism. German shepherds were coveted as \"germanische Urhunde\", being close to the wolf, and became very fashionable during the Nazi era. Adolf Hitler acquired a German Shepherd named \"Prinz\" in 1921, during his years of poverty, but he had been forced to lodge the dog elsewhere. However, she managed to escape and return to him. Hitler, who adored the loyalty and obedience of the dog, thereafter developed a great liking for the breed. Hitler kept several more of the breed, including Blondi, who was among several dogs in the 'F\u00fchrerbunker' during the Battle of Berlin at the end of the Second World War. Dogs played a role in Nazi propaganda by portraying Hitler as an animal lover. Preparing for his suicide, Hitler ordered Dr. Werner Haase to test a cyanide capsule on Blondi, and the dog died as a result. Erna Flegel, a nurse who worked at the emergency casualty station in the Reich Chancellery stated in 2005 that Blondi's death had affected the people in the bunker more than Eva Braun's suicide. German Shepherds were also used widely as guard dogs at Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust.When the German Shepherd was introduced to the United States it was initially a popular dog. But as the dogs' popularity grew, it became associated as a dangerous breed owned by gangsters and bootleggers. The reputation of the German shepherds as a dangerous breed had grown to such an extent that it was briefly banned to import them in Australia in 1929. Potential legislation was even considered to require that all German shepherds in South Australia be sterilised.,The breed was named Deutscher Sch\u00e4ferhund, by von Stephanitz, literally translating to \"German Shepherd Dog\".  At the time, all other herding dogs in Germany were referred to by this name; they thus became known as Altdeutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde, or Old German herding dogs.,The direct translation of the name was adopted for use in the stud-book; however, at the end of the First World War, it was believed that the inclusion of the word \"German\" would harm the breed's popularity, due to the anti-German sentiment of the era. The breed was officially renamed by the UK Kennel Club to \"Alsatian Wolf Dog\", after the French region of Alsace bordering Germany.Eventually, the appendage \"wolf dog\" was dropped, after numerous campaigns by breeders who were worried that becoming known as a wolf-dog hybrid would affect the breed's popularity and legality. The name Alsatian remained for five decades, until 1977, when successful campaigns by dog enthusiasts pressured the British kennel clubs to allow the breed to be registered again as German Shepherds. The word \"Alsatian\" once appeared in parentheses as part of the formal breed name of the American Kennel Club and was removed in 2010." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c617" }, "breed": "South Russian Ovcharka", "origin": "Ukraine, Russia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Russian_Ovcharka", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/South_Russian_Ovcharka.jpg/220px-South_Russian_Ovcharka.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5fc0" }, "breed": "South Russian Ovcharka", "contenido": "The South Russian Ovcharka or South Russian Shepherd Dog is breed of flock guardian dog developed in the Russian Empire and in the Soviet Union.

The breed standard was approved early in the 1930s.The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale definitively accepted it on 30 September 1983 as the Yuzhnorusskaya Ovcharka or South Russian Shepherd Dog.,It is a large dog: dogs stand no less that 66 cm at the withers and weigh at least 35 kg; bitches are about 4 cm smaller and weigh some 5 kg less.

Despite this, it has retained its terrier strength of character. The Welsh Terrier has been claimed to be the oldest existing dog breed in the UK.The Welsh Terrier was a latecomer to the British show-ring (being primarily a working dog) and was not officially registered as a breed until the 19th century. It is on the UK Kennel Club's list of breeds that are in danger of dying out, having as few as 300 or so pups registered annually. The most popular breeds are registered in tens of thousands each year.,The Welsh Terrier is coloured tan on the head, legs and underbelly with a black or sometimes grizzle saddle. Females are sometimes a simple darker tan all over. The breed is a sturdy and compact dog of about medium size that can grow up to 15.5 in (39 cm) with a weight of 20\u201322 pounds (9.1\u201310.0 kg). The tail was usually docked until this was prohibited in the United Kingdom in 2006, being preferred in order to complete the image of a square dog, as tall as it is long. The body shape is rectangular, with an elongated, \"brick-like\" face.  This shape is formed by the whiskers and beard. With pedigrees the face can take a more oval shape and be finer boned and more distinct.,The hair contains two layers, an undercoat that insulates and abrasive fur on top that protects against dirt, rain, and wind. Welsh Terriers are born mostly all black and during the first year they change colour to standard black and tan grizzle.,This breed does not shed  (see Moult). However, the coat requires regular grooming maintenance including brushing and hand stripping.,An undocked Welsh Terrier tail is only an inch or so longer than a docked tail and does not make a great deal of difference to the overall appearance. The coat does not moult out but old hairs will eventually be stripped out through play and movement if the coat is not regularly raked. Ungroomed coats can also fade and thin out as the old hair loses colour and texture.,The Welsh Terrier closely resembles a compact Airedale Terrier." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c61f" }, "breed": "Lapponian Shepherd", "origin": null, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapponian_Shepherd", "img": "Not available", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f11" }, "breed": "Lapponian Shepherd", "contenido": "The Lapponian Shepherd (Lapinpaimenkoira) or Cockhill's Finnish Lapphound (Kukonharjunkoira) is an extinct dog breed originating from Finland.

This is how a new breed called Cockhill's Finnish Lapphound was developed and in 1945, it was officially registered as the Lapponian Shepherd. However, the Finnish Lapphund and the Lapponian Herder were soon added under the same breed name and, therefore, all three of these breeds began to cross with each other.In 1967, the Finnish Kennel Club (the Suomen Kennelliitto) decided to split the Lapponian Shepherd breed into two separate breeds called the Finnish Lapphund and the Lapponian Herder.

Chukotka sled dog teams have been used since prehistoric times to pulls sleds in harsh conditions, such as hunting sea mammals on oceanic pack ice. While most famous as the progenitor of the Siberian husky, Chukotka Sled Dogs almost died out during the Soviet era due to lack of interest in preserving genetically purebred examples and have only recently made a resurgence. In 1999, the Russian Kynologic Federation (RKF) approved the first official standard of the breed.,The Chukotka Sled Dog was developed by the Chukchi people as a hardy, reliable method of hunting marine mammals on sea ice and transportation in the mountainous tundra of the Chukchi peninsula, where windswept slopes prevent the accumulation of snow. Archeological evidence from before 500 AD indicates that local populations were relying heavily on whales as a food source and that dogsled was the primary means of transporting marine mammals to human settlements.Sportswoman and author M. G. Dmitrieva-Sulima would describe them as a unique breed in her 1911 book, \"Laika and hunting with it.\",From the 1890s to the 1930s, Chukotka sled dogs were actively exported to Alaska, to transport gold miners to the Yukon as part of the Klondike Gold Rush. then later for the \"All-Alaska Sweepstakes,\" a 408-mile (657-km) distance dog sled race in Alaska. At this time, \"Esquimaux\" or \"Eskimo\" was a common pejorative term for native North American Arctic inhabitants with many dialectal permutations including Uskee, Uskimay and Huskemaw. Thus dogs used by Arctic people were the dogs of the Huskies, the Huskie's dogs, and eventually simply the husky dogs. Canadian and American settlers, not well versed on Russian geography, would distinguish the Chukotka imports by referring to them as Siberian huskies as Chukotka is part of Siberia.,In 1913, Leonhard Seppala inherited a team of Chukotka sled dogs by chance. Jafet Lindeberg, his friend and supervisor at Pioneer Mining Company, had brought the puppies from Siberia as a gift for the explorer Roald Amundsen, whom he hoped would use them for his upcoming expedition to the North Pole. Seppala was assigned to train the dogs. \"I literally fell in love with them from the start\", he recalled; \"I could hardly wait for sledding snow to start their training\". When Amundsen cancelled his trip a few weeks after the puppies arrived in Nome, Lindeberg gave them to Seppala. Smaller, faster and more enduring than the 100- to 120-pound (45- to 54-kg) freighting dogs then in general use, Siberian huskies immediately dominated the Sweepstakes race.,In 1930, the Soviet Union halted the exportation of dogs from Siberia and the American Kennel Club recognized the Siberian Husky as a breed.  Dogs living in the Soviet Union at the time would continue on as Chukotka sled dogs while dogs residing in the United States and Canada would go on to form the foundational stock of the Siberian Husky.In the 1950s and 60s, improvements in infrastructure and mechanized travel coupled with a prohibition on subsistent whaling resulted in the collapse of indigenous dog sled populations in Chukotka. Sled dog populations continued to decline until 1988 when a regional survey revealed only 1594 dogs, not all of which were purebred. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, widespread food insecurity in Russia coupled with a special dispensation in whaling for native Chukchi people, have contributed to a resurging interest in preserving Chukotka sled dogs in the Chukotka Peninsula. There are estimated to be 4000 Chukotka sled dogs today, although it is unclear how many are purebred." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5a7" }, "breed": "Kur\u012b", "origin": "New Zealand", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kur%C4%AB", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Otago_Museum_Kuri_-_OMNZVT2162_03_%28cropped%29.jpg/220px-Otago_Museum_Kuri_-_OMNZVT2162_03_%28cropped%29.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f09" }, "breed": "Kur\u012b", "contenido": "The Hawaiian Poi Dog (Hawaiian: \u02bb\u012blio or \u02bb\u012blio m\u0101ku\u02bbe) is an extinct breed of pariah dog from Hawai\u02bbi which was used by Native Hawaiians as a spiritual protector of children and as a source of food.,The original Hawaiian poi dog were descended from the Polynesian dogs brought to the Hawaiian Islands by the Polynesian people. Genetic studies on the New Zealand Kur\u012b dog indicate that the origin of this dog (and therefore probably the Hawaiian dog) is Indonesia. Referred as the \u02bb\u012blio in the Hawaiian language, the modern name of this breed is derived from poi, a Hawaiian staple food made from kalo or taro root. Poi was used to fatten the dogs for use as food because meat was too valuable to be used as dog food. Since the Hawaiian Islands did not have large land mammals other than feral hogs, Poi dogs were not needed for hunting. The dogs were never deliberately bred to a standard, but human and natural selection still came into play.,European explorers like Captain Cook encountered pot-bellied, short-legged poi dogs that freely associated with hogs in the village. The dogs had very short hair that could come in any color, but brown poi dogs were regarded as distinct enough to warrant a specific name. The dogs also had peculiarly flattened heads. The latter trait is sometimes ascribed to the diet of the dogs in some unspecified way. Considering that poi does not require chewing, the dogs might have lost the need to maintain strong temporalis muscles; a reduced temporal fossa will cause a dog's head to appear flattened. Poi dogs were considered rather dim-witted and sluggish \u2013 any good hunting dog with acute senses would neither make a good poi dog nor be particularly useful on the islands \u2013 however, the dogs were strong-willed and not easily commanded.The poi dog was a two-purpose breed \u2013 used for food and as a lucky charm. Unsuited for anything else, the breed declined to extinction as the native religion was abandoned and eating dog meat became unfashionable. Feral dogs of European settlers interbred with the poi dogs, and by the early 20th century at latest, the breed disappeared as a distinct entity.,No surviving artwork or photograph from Hawaiian history are authentically attributed as poi dogs. Often Western artists infused Euro-American characteristics in their 18th-century depictions of the dogs of Polynesia and by the 19th century, the dogs being depicted were of foreign breeds. The lack of details has led historians to guess at what works may be realistic depictions of the breed based on the physical characteristics.Writers Katharine Luomala and Margaret Titcomb both agreed an unfinished line drawing, dated to c. 1816\u201317, by French artist Louis Choris, who was part of the exploring expedition of Otto von Kotzebue, may show one of the dogs in center which may resemble the extinct breed. Luomala also claims French artist Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Lauvergne possibly captured a dog with the same traits in his colored drawing of Honolulu Harbor in 1836.Ancient Hawaiian petroglyphs also depict simplified representation of the dogs. They often show the curl tails and pointed ears characteristics of the breed." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5a8" }, "breed": "Limer", "origin": null, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limer", "img": "Not available", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f16" }, "breed": "Limer", "contenido": "A limer, or lymer , was a kind of dog, a scenthound, used on a leash in medieval times to find large game before it was hunted down by the pack.  It was sometimes known as a lyam hound/dog  or lime-hound, from the Middle English word lyam, meaning 'leash'.  The French cognate limier has sometimes been used for the dogs in English as well.  The type is not to be confused with the bandog, which was also a dog controlled by a leash, typically a chain, but was a watchdog or guard dog.,In medieval hunting in France and Great Britain, certain kinds of game were not found and hunted with a full pack, as usual in modern hunting. Instead, they were first found by a limer.,The limer would be taken out at dawn by its handler, on foot, who would identify, perhaps from droppings, perhaps from footprints, where a large animal had passed during the night. He would set his hound on the trail, until it had found where the animal was browsing or at rest. This required keen scenting, the ability to ignore all other scents which might be a distraction, and silent trailing. This process became known as 'harbouring' the animal.Several limers might be sent out to different parts of the forest. The handlers would then report back to their lord, or the chief huntsman, who would decide on the one \"which seemed to have harbored the greatest and oldest Deere, and hym which lyeth in the fairest covert\". Then the huntsmen would bring the pack of scent hounds, known as 'raches', or 'running hounds'. Raches might be set in relays along the path where the quarry could be expected to run, held in couples, to be released on the huntsman's signal. The game animal would be put to flight or 'unharboured' and the pack would follow it on its hot scent until it was brought to bay and killed.   ,If the quarry escaped the pack, perhaps wounded, or if the hunt was overtaken by nightfall, the huntsmen would mark the point where the quarry was last known to have been, and the lords and ladies of the hunt would return to the hunting lodge, or to the  pavilions which had been erected for them in the forest, to sleep or occupy themselves with feasting. The limer and its handler would then set about the task of harbouring the quarry again, perhaps by following its blood-trail, and either the injured animal would be dispatched, or the hunt would resume as before.,The limer was a specialist tracker, probably outnumbered by raches in a lord's pack, in about the proportions 20:1, and it was highly valued. It is possible that on occasions it might be released to pursue the quarry with the pack, but normally it did not take part in the kill. The limer which had harboured the particular quarry should, according to the manuals, be the first to be rewarded with its special part of the carcass during the process of butchering it, apparent in this link, where the leashed hound is favoured with the head of the stag, while the raches wait impatiently for their share. It had its own special attendant who looked after it and handled it: the 'valet de limier', translated by Turbervile as 'the varlet who keeps the bloodhound'.To do its work, the limer had to wear a collar, the modern tracking harness surprisingly being unthought of in a period when everyone must have been familiar with the harnesses and tack of horses, and the leash had to be long enough to allow the hound to cast. Edward, Duke of York in The Master of Game 1406\u20131413 (a translation of Livre de la Chasse) :[2] writes (Chapter XX):,And the length of the hounds' couples between the hounds should be a foot, and the rope of a limer three fathoms and a half, be he ever so wise a limer it sufficeth." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5a9" }, "breed": "Molossus", "origin": "Epirus, ancient Greece", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molossus_(dog)", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Molossian_Hound%2C_British_Museum.jpg/220px-Molossian_Hound%2C_British_Museum.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f28" }, "breed": "Molossus", "contenido": "The Molossus (Greek: \u039c\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) (also known as the Molossian hound, Epirus mastiff) was a breed of dog from Ancient Greece.,The Molossus were dogs that were kept by the ancient Greek tribe and kingdom of the Molossians, who inhabited the region of Epirus.The Molossus were famous throughout the ancient world for their size and ferocity and were frequently mentioned in ancient literature, including the writings of Aristophanes, Aristotle, Grattius, Horace, Lucan, Lucretius, Martial, Nemesianus, Oppian of Apamea, Plautus, Seneca, Statius, Ovid, and Virgil. The Molossians issued silver coinage with an image of a Molossus as their emblem.It is sometimes stated in books and magazines, particularly in Continental Europe and North America, that all mastiff-type dogs are descended from the Molossus. This theory states the breed's progenitors arrived in Molossia from Asia and were eventually discovered by the Romans who employed large numbers as guards for the Roman Army; this theory speculates that the various mastiff breeds found throughout Europe descend from dogs left behind by the Romans. This theory has been questioned by many experts who state it relies on guesswork and lacks historical evidence, and that mastiffs likely developed elsewhere.Another story is that in the course of his military conquests Alexander the Great discovered some giant dogs in Asia that impressed him so much that he sent some home; as the son of a Molossi princess these dogs became associated with his mother's people and that it was from these dogs that all mastiffs descend.It seems most likely that Molossi kept two distinct types of dogs, one a hunting dog with a broad muzzle which resembled something in between a Great Dane and a heavily built Saluki, the other a large livestock guardian dog. Aristotle in his History of Animals wrote \"In the Molossian race of dogs, those employed in hunting differ in no respect from other dogs; while those employed in following sheep are larger and more fierce in their attack on wild beasts.\" He also added that dogs that are born of a mixed breed between the Molossian and the Laconian dogs are remarkable for courage and endurance of hard labour.Polycrates of Samos imported Molossian and Laconian dogs to the island.According to Greek mythology the goddess Artemis gave to Procris a dog, Laelaps, that never failed to catch its prey and from this dog derived the Molossian and Laconian hounds.,A number of modern kennel clubs, including the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, group the distinct mastiffs with livestock guardian dogs as a single type they call \"molossoid\".

When this had been done, the huntsman reported back to his lord, who then brought the pack of raches to chase it down on its hot scent when it had been unharboured, 'rowsed' or 'upreared'. Sometimes, pairs of raches were held at strategic points along where the quarry was expected to run, to be uncoupled when the huntsman blew the signal, or when the quarry was seen to come close. The Bloodhound was typically used as a limer, and the raches were normally smaller hounds. A lord's pack would include one or two limers to about 20 or more raches.,A king or lord would want to hunt a great stag, a 'hart of ten', or 'warrantable' stag, or a powerful boar, partly for the extra fat it carried when in prime condition in the hunting season, but mostly for kudos.,In Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Bloodhounds announce the presence of a great boar hiding in a thicket, which then rushes out and plays havoc among the raches of the knight's pack.,Not all game was hunted using the limer. Dame Juliana Berners, writing in The Book of Saint Albans (1486) writes (translation): ,'My dear sons, I will now teach each one of you how many kinds of beasts must be upreared with the limer in wood or in fields - both the hart and the buck and the boar so wild. All other animals which are hunted must be sought and found with free-running raches (\"ratches so fre\").',Other writers might include the hare, bear, or wolf among animals to be harboured with the limer, but clearly raches could be hunted simply as a pack, as in modern hunting, if chasing 'lesser' game.,After c. 1530 the term 'rache' was hardly used in England, 'running hound' (tr. of chien courant), or mostly just 'hound', being preferred, but the term was still used for a while in Scotland, where the Bloodhound was called the sleuth hound.  Hector Boece (1536) describes the rache in Scotland as a versatile scenthound, able to find flesh, fowl, or even fish among the rocks, by smelling. His translator, Bellenden, says that it is not a large as the sleuth hound. The picture below, though it did not appear in Boece's original, was first published to illustrate his account when it was summarised in Conrad Gessner's Historiae Animalium (Zurich 1554, in Latin).,Obviously raches must have far outnumbered Bloodhounds in the medieval dog population, and may have been quite disparate, depending on the sort of game they were used to hunt. In the picture above from Les Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry (1410) the raches are not all of the same breed. In Great Britain, they may have included the now-extinct North Country Beagle and Southern Hound. As styles of hunting changed, and the Bloodhound fell out of use, packs were normally employed on their own to hunt all quarry. Though their name became obsolete, raches must have continued in this use. We may assume that it was from them, rather than the Bloodhound, that the various breeds of pack hounds such as the English Foxhound, English Staghound, Harrier and Beagle were developed. It is apparent that in the 16th and 17th centuries there was a good deal of regional variation in sizes and types of scenthound, from which the prospective Master of Hounds could mix and match to form his pack." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5b3" }, "breed": "Saint John's water dog", "origin": "modern-day Canada", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._John%27s_water_dog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/St_Johns_dog.jpg/220px-St_Johns_dog.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5f93" }, "breed": "Saint John's water dog", "contenido": "The Rastreador Brasileiro (in English, Brazilian Tracker) is a large breed of dog from Brazil, first recognised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 1967, but an outbreak of disease, compounded by an overdose of insecticide, wiped out the breed's entire breeding stock.

Similar to other strains of Polynesian dogs, it was introduced to the Society Islands and Tahiti by the ancestors of the Tahitian (M\u0101\u2019ohi) people during their migrations to Polynesia. They were an essential part of traditional Tahitian society; their meat was included in Tahitian cuisine and other parts of the dog were used to make tools and ornamental clothing. Dogs were fed a vegetarian diet and served during feasts as a delicacy. European explorers were the first outsiders to observe and record their existence, and they were served to early explorers including Captain James Cook. The Tahitian Dog disappeared as a distinct breed after the introduction of foreign European dogs.,The Tahitian Dog, known as the \u02bb\u016ar\u012b M\u0101\u2019ohi in the Tahitian language, was introduced to Tahiti and the Society Islands (in modern French Polynesia) by the ancestors of the Tahitian (M\u0101\u2019ohi) people during their migrations to Polynesia. They were closely related to the Hawaiian Poi Dog and the New Zealand Kur\u012b; the latter is believed to be a descendant of the breed. Similar breeds of Polynesian dogs were brought alongside pigs and chickens when the people settled the islands of Polynesia. Genetic studies indicate that the New Zealand Kuri/dog is derived from Indonesian dogs, and therefore by inference it is likely that Society island dogs are of the same origin. The Marquesan Dog became extinct in the neighboring Marquesas Islands before 1595. Even though dogs were virtually absent from Western Polynesia, they were recognized when European explorers later brought them as items of trade, indicating a universal cultural recognition of the dog in the many islands.Dogs were tied with strings around the belly and kept in the house, where they were raised as a food source alongside domesticated pigs. Seen as a delicacy, they were served during feasts and to the high chiefs. Dogs were less abundant than pigs in the islands, possibly because they were killed while they were young. European visitors noticed that native women, especially those who lost their own children, would often breastfeed puppies and small pigs.,They were an essential part of traditional Tahitian society. Dog teeth were fashioned into fishhooks and dog bones were made into weapons and implements. They also used dog hair, especially the long tail hairs of the Tuamotuan varieties of dogs, to decorate the fringes of the taumi \u2013 a traditional breast ornament often called a gorget \u2013 which were worn by priests and high chiefs. The Tuamotuan breed were described as similar to their Tahitian counterparts distinguishable by their longer hair. Historian Margaret Titcomb noted that Tuamotuan varieties may not have been a separate breed that developed in isolation, arguing that the people of the Tuamotus could have eaten their short haired varieties and kept their longer haired dogs for exports to the Society Islands.The Tahitian Dog became extinct in the Society Islands some time after the arrival of European settlers due to the introduction of, and interbreeding with, European dog breeds. By 1834, British traveler Frederick Debell Bennett noted: \"Amongst the Society Islands, the aboriginal dog, which was formerly eaten as a delicacy by the natives, is now extinct, or merged into mongrel breeds by propagation with many exotic varieties.\" Most other breeds of Polynesian dogs also became extinct due to interbreeding with foreign dogs by the beginning of the 20th century.This breed and other Polynesian dogs were sometimes considered a distinct species by 18th century naturalists and scientists, and received scientific names such as Canis domesticus, indicus taitiensis (1778) by Georg Forster, Canis familiaris villaticus, meridionalis (1817) by F. L. Walther, Canis otahitensis (1836) or Canis familiaris orthotus otahitensis (1836) by Heinrich Gottlieb Ludwig Reichenbach, Canis pacificus (1845) by Charles Hamilton Smith, and Canis familiaris otahitensis (1859) by Christoph Gottfried Andreas Giebel. Luomala noted that the \"source material of taxonomists has been derived, often at second- and third-hand, from impressionistic descriptions by members of the expeditions of Captain Cook and other eighteenth-century explorers, none of whom give a single measurement or preserved a specimen for scientific study\".,The Tahitian Dogs were described as having a small or medium build, resembling terriers or crooked-legged dachshund in size. Their coats were usually brown, white or rust-yellow with smooth hairs. They had broad heads, small eyes, long backs, sharp-pointed muzzles and erect ears. They were described as lazy, shy, and not ferocious, but as having notoriously bad dispositions. They seldom barked but sometimes howled. Often they are lumped together with the Hawaiian Poi Dog by 19th-century taxonomists because of their similar appearance and diet, in contrast to the Kur\u012b, which was much larger in size due to their higher protein diet.Their diet included breadfruits, coconuts, yams, poi made from taro and sometimes fish. This soft vegetarian diet caused the dogs to develop round skulls and a small stature.German naturalist Georg Forster wrote generally about the Polynesian dogs, but more specifically in response to the ones he saw in the Society Islands during a visit to Huahine in September 1773:,The dogs of all these islands were short, and their sizes vary from that of a lap-dog to the largest spaniel. Their head is broad, the snout pointed, the eyes very small, the ears upright, and their hair rather long, lank, hard, and of different colours, but most commonly white and brown. They seldom if ever barked, but howled sometimes, and were shy of strangers to a degree of aversion." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5c0" }, "breed": "Alopekis", "origin": "Greece mainly in the Serres region.", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alopekis", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Alopekis_white_male.jpg/220px-Alopekis_white_male.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5de4" }, "breed": "Alopekis", "contenido": "The Alopekis (Greek: \u0391\u03bb\u03c9\u03c0\u03b5\u03ba\u03af\u03c2) is a small, foxlike dog from Greece with pricked ears, a sickle-shaped tail, and a smooth short coat.The dog is found in the Serres region of Greece and dates before 1922.

It is a spaniel type dog that is closely related to the English Cocker Spaniel; the two breeds diverged during the 20th century due to differing breed standards in the US and the UK. In the United States, the breed is usually called a Cocker Spaniel, while elsewhere in the world, it is called an American Cocker Spaniel to distinguish it from its older English cousin. The word cocker is commonly held to stem from their use to hunt woodcock in England, while spaniel is thought to be derived from the breed's origins in Spain.,The first spaniel in America came across with the Mayflower in 1620, but it was not until 1878 that the first Cocker Spaniel was registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC). A national breed club was set up three years later and the dog considered to be the father of the modern breed, Ch. Obo II, was born around this time. By the 1920s the English and American varieties of Cocker had become noticeably different and in 1946 the AKC recognized the English type as a separate breed. It was not until 1970 that The Kennel Club in the UK recognized the American Cocker Spaniel as being separate from the English type. The American Cocker was the most popular breed in the United States during the 1940s and 1950s and again during the 1980s, reigning for a total of 18 years. They have also won the best in show title at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show on four occasions, the best in show title at Crufts in 2017, and have been linked to the President of the United States on several occasions, with owners including Richard Nixon and Harry S. Truman.  In 2013, the cocker spaniel ranked 29th the American Kennel Club registration statistics of historical comparisons and notable trends.,The breed is the smallest of the sporting dogs recognized by the AKC, and its distinctly shaped head makes it immediately recognizable. In addition, there are some marked differences between it and its English relative. It is a happy breed with average working intelligence, although by being bred to a show standard it is no longer an ideal working dog. Members of the breed suffer from a wide variety of health ailments including problems with their hearts, eyes and ears.,The word spanyell is thought to date from the late 12th century when it was used to name a type of dog imported into England from Spain, with the span part of the word referring to the country of origin. Records from the mid-14th century show that selective breeding was already in place, with the breed being separated into two distinct types, called water spaniels and land spaniels. By 1801, the smaller variety of land spaniel was called the Cocker or Cocking Spaniel, so named for its use in flushing woodcock.According to historical records, the first spaniel was brought to North America aboard the Mayflower which sailed from Plymouth, England and landed in New England in 1620. The first Cocker Spaniel recorded in America was a liver and white dog named Captain, who was registered with the American Kennel Club in 1878. In 1881, the American Cocker Spaniel Club was formed; it would later become the American Spaniel Club (ASC) and is now known as the oldest breed club for dogs in the United States. The task of the club was initially to create a standard to separate the Cocker Spaniel in America from other types of land spaniels, a task which would take over 20 years, only being completed in 1905.The dog considered to be the father of the American Cocker Spaniel was sired by the dog considered to be the father of the English Cocker Spaniel. Ch. Obo was bred to Ch. Chloe II, who was shipped to America while she was pregnant. Once in the United States, she whelped a dog who became Ch. Obo II. He differed greatly from the modern breed, being only 10 inches (25 cm) tall and with a long body, but was considered to be an excellent dog of that era and became a popular sire.Towards the end of the 19th century, the breed had become popular in America and Canada due to their dual use as a family pet and a working dog. In the early 20th century the breeders on either side of the Atlantic had created different breed standards for the Cocker Spaniel and the breed gradually diverged from one another, with the two becoming noticeably different by the 1920s. The American Cockers by now had a smaller muzzle, their coats were softer and the dogs overall were lighter and smaller. The differences were so apparent that in 1935, breeders founded the English Cocker Spaniel Club and restricted breeding between the two types of spaniel. The two types of Cocker Spaniel in America were shown together as one breed, with the English type as a variety of the main breed, until 1946 when the American Kennel Club recognized the English Cocker Spaniel as a separate breed.,Initially in the United Kingdom there were a few American Cockers that had accompanied service personnel to American bases in the 1950s and 1960s. In addition, several came over with embassy staff and business people returning home.The first UK Kennel Club registered American Cocker Spaniel was Aramingo Argonaught, born January 17, 1956 and bred by Herbert L. Steinberg. Two judges confirmed that the dog was an American Cocker and not an English Cocker before the Kennel Club permitted the dog to be shown. In the 1960s they were shown as a rare breed, which meant that they did not have a show class of their own and could only be shown in variety classes. This included Aramingo Argonaught, who was the first American Cocker Spaniel to be shown at Crufts in 1960 in a class entitled \"Any variety not classified at this show\". In 1968, the KC agreed to have the breed shown in the category \"Any variety gundog other than Cocker\" and stated that the American Cocker was not a variety of \"Spaniel (Cocker)\". There were around 100 registrations between 1966 and 1968.In 1970 the breed was given a separate register in the Kennel Club Breed Supplement, as it was previously included in \"Any other variety\". Registration numbers increased to 309 by 1970 following this full recognition." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5c8" }, "breed": "Bernese Mountain Dog", "origin": "Switzerland", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernese_Mountain_Dog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Othello.jpg/220px-Othello.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c729" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/bernese_mountain_dog.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 5, "shedding": 5, "grooming": 3, "drooling": 3, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 4, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 3, "trainability": 4, "energy": 4, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 7, "max_life_expectancy": 10, "max_height_male": 27.5, "max_height_female": 27.5, "max_weight_male": 115, "max_weight_female": 95, "min_height_male": 25, "min_height_female": 25, "min_weight_male": 80, "min_weight_female": 70, "breed": "Bernese Mountain Dog" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e16" }, "breed": "Bernese Mountain Dog", "contenido": "The Bernese Mountain Dog (German: Berner Sennenhund) is a large dog breed, one of the four breeds of Sennenhund-type dogs from the Swiss Alps.

They were originally used for general farm work including cattle droving, sheep herding, and cart pulling, and nowadays as guard dogs and police dogs, as well as being kept as pets. The French name of the breed means, literally, \"Cow Herder of Flanders\", referring to the Flemish origin of the breed. Other names for the breed are Toucheur de Boeuf (cattle driver), Vlaamse Koehond (Flemish cow dog), and Vuilbaard (dirty beard).,The monks at the Ter Duinen monastery were among the earliest known dog breeders in Flanders. The bouviers bred by them are recorded as having been bred from imports such as Irish wolfhounds and Scottish deerhounds with local farm dogs, until a breed considered to be the predecessor of the modern Bouvier des Flandres was obtained. This became a working dog able to perform tirelessly, herding and guarding cattle and even pulling cargo carts, thanks to its strength and temperament, and to withstand the local weather conditions due to its thick coat. The breed's practical use became antiquated after the invention of the automobile, when cattle were more practically transported by trucks.Historically, the ear cropping and tail docking could have been done for practical reasons, avoiding accidental amputations in the course of work, or to indicate the dog was working stock and not a pet subject to taxation.,Up until the early 20th century, the breed was not completely defined, with three variants: Paret, Moerman or Roeselare, and Briard. Conflict between the proponents of these three variants held the breed's development back. In 1912 and 1913, several local kennel clubs recognized standards for Bouviers; however they usually had different standards for the Roeselare and other variants.World War I nearly caused the breed to disappear, due to the devastation that came over its region of origin and the fact that the dogs were used for military purposes. Indeed, Nic, a male trained as a trench dog who served during the war and was a perennial winner at dog shows after the war, is considered to be the founder of the early Bouvier des Flandres breed.A unified Bouvier des Flandres standard was created in 1936 by a joint French-Belgian committee. However, World War II again endangered the breed's existence. Due to these setbacks, progress was slowed, and it was not until 1965 that the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) breed standard, as agreed to by several minor kennel clubs, was adopted.,The Bouvier is a powerfully built, compact, rough-coated dog of rugged appearance. It gives the impression of size and strength without clumsiness or heaviness. Perhaps its most notable feature is the impressive head which is accentuated by a heavy beard and mustache. Although the practice of cropping both ears and tail are now mostly cosmetic, tails were originally docked to prevent injuries caused by herding and cart-pulling. The practice of cosmetic docking is currently opposed by the American Veterinary Medical Association. In the area of origin (Flanders, Belgium) cropping was made illegal in 2006. The weight of males ranges from 80 to 120 pounds or 36 to 54 kilograms, slightly smaller for females. They are powerfully built, with a thick double coat, which can be fawn, black, grey brindle, or \"pepper and salt\" in color. Bouviers are sometimes considered non-shedding, but in fact do lose hair, like all dogs. Most of the hair that they lose is caught within the double coat which results in matting. They require weekly brushing and combing to maintain the coat. In addition to weekly brushing, the coat should be trimmed approximately every 3\u20135 weeks if it is to be a show dog. Trimming requires practice to achieve the proper look." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5d6" }, "breed": "Bull Arab", "origin": "Australia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_Arab", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Bull_Arab_%28dog%29.jpg/220px-Bull_Arab_%28dog%29.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e3d" }, "breed": "Bull Arab", "contenido": "The Bull Arab is a type of dog developed in Australia for pig hunting.

The breed is able to locate feral pigs as far as 4\u20136 kilometres (2.5\u20133.7 mi) away by smell.,Bull Arabs have a calm temperament, are highly intelligent and easily trainable, and are known for their loyalty and their love of people.The breed has a reputation for aggression which according to RSPCA Australia is due to the media and public perception.  Attacks on people in several states of Australia have been attributed to the breed, although according to the Mackay Regional Council proportionally in no greater numbers than other dog breeds.  Attacks on livestock including the killing of a number of sheep and other animals have been attributed to Bull Arabs that had escaped their owners and/or confinement.  It has been stated that there is a little hard data to support the breed's reputation for aggression and the perception problems are caused by the people who own the dogs and a lack of socialisation.The breed is cited as being used for companion and therapy animals.,Due to restrictions on rental housing agreements in Queensland that prohibit larger sized dog breeds, many large breeds of dogs including Bull Arabs are often abandoned in that state.  RSPCA Australia also attributes this to a perceived rise in pig hunting, with hunters not desexing their animals, resulting in litters often being dumped." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5da" }, "breed": "Can de Chira", "origin": "Aragon (Spain)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_de_Chira", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Can_de_Chira_antiguo2.jpg/220px-Can_de_Chira_antiguo2.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e49" }, "breed": "Can de Chira", "contenido": "The Can de Chira (also known as the perro pastor altoaragon\u00e9s) is a breed of herding dog from the High Aragon region of Spain.Accounts of similar dogs used by Spanish graziers to herd sheep and cattle (in Aragonese \"Can de Chira\" literally it means \"dog for turn\" or \"return the cattle\") date back several centuries, the oldest photographs date from the early 19th century.

After the collapse of the mezzadria system of share-cropping in the 1960s, the dogs became rare. The modern breed derives from selective breeding from about 1980 of a few surviving animals. A breed society, the Societ\u00e0 Amatori Cane Corso, was formed in 1983.:\u200a107\u200a The breed was recognised by the Ente Nazionale della Cinofilia Italiana in 1994; it was provisionally accepted by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 1996, and received full acceptance in 2007. It was recognised by the American Kennel Club of the United States in 2010.In the period 2011\u20132019 annual registrations in Italy were in the range of 3000\u20134250.,The Cane Corso is a large dog of molossoid type, and is closely related to the Neapolitan Mastiff. It is well muscled and less bulky than most other mastiff breeds. According to the international standard, dogs should stand some 62\u201370 cm at the withers and weigh 45\u201350 kg; females are about 4 cm smaller, and weigh some 5 kg less.The head is large, slightly over one third of the height at the withers in length, with a well-defined stop. The top of the cranium is flat and slightly convergent to the muzzle. The eyes are oval in shape, and set well apart. The iris of the eye should be as dark as possible.The coat is short, dense and lustrous. It may be black, or various shades of grey (lead-grey, light grey or slate-grey) or fawn (dark fawn, light fawn, or stag red); it may be brindled. Minor white markings on the chest, the feet or the nose are tolerated.A 2017 study of 232 Cane Corso dogs from 25 countries found an average life span of 9.3 years, varying with different coat colours. The longest living were black brindle dogs (10.3 years) followed by brindle dogs (10.1 years), grey brindle dogs (9.8 years), fawn dogs (9.0 years), black dogs (9.0 years), grey dogs (9.0 years) and other colour dogs (8.1 years).,The Cane Corso is usually kept as a companion dog or guard dog; it may also be used to protect livestock.

The breed had its glory in the 1930s, when it was relatively common on farms all around. The Danish main job of the breed was to take care of the children, and it was therefore commonly known as the children's dog.

The Dobermann has a long muzzle. It stands on its pads and is not usually heavy-footed. Ideally, they have an even and graceful gait. Traditionally, the ears are cropped and posted and the tail is docked. However, in some countries, these procedures are now illegal and it is often considered cruel and unnecessary. Dobermans have markings on the chest, paws/legs, muzzle, above the eyes, and underneath the tail.,Dobermanns are known to be intelligent, alert, and tenaciously loyal companions and guard dogs. Personality varies a great deal between each individual but, if taken care of and properly trained, they are generally considered to be loving and devoted companions. The Dobermann is driven, strong, and sometimes stubborn. With a consistent approach, they can be easy to train and will learn very quickly.,World breed standards are published by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, or FCI (World Canine Organisation), on the advice of the IDC (International Dobermann Club), which is the Dobermann breed's governing council and has 36 countries in its member list. To become a world champion, dogs are judged to FCI standards. The AKC has its own standards, as do some other countries, although most still adhere to FCI standards. The breed standard describes the Dobermann as a dog of medium size that is also strong and muscularly built. In order to be eligible to meet these standards, the body of the Dobermann should appear to be almost square.,It should also appear elegant and noble.,The dog was originally intended as a guard dog, so males typically have a muscular and intimidating appearance. Females are usually thinner, but should not be spindly.,The American Kennel Club (AKC) breed standard differs from the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) standards, with the latter being an often larger and heavier dog. This has led some to argue that Dobermanns and Doberman Pinschers should be considered and evaluated differently.,Although the breed standards vary among kennel and breed clubs, most follow the standard set by the FCI, which describes the size of male dogs as 68 to 72 centimetres (27 to 28 in) at the withers; The Kennel Club in the UK quotes 69 centimetres (27 in) as being ideal. The size of female dogs, according to the same standards, is 63 to 68 centimetres (25 to 27 in), with 65 centimetres (26 in) being ideal. The Dobermann has a square frame; its length should equal its height to the withers and the length of its head, neck, and legs should be in proportion to its body.The standards for the weight of the Dobermann are also described by the FCI. The ideal dog must be of a sufficient size for an optimal combination of strength, endurance and agility. The ideal weight of male dogs is described as 40\u201345 kilograms (88\u201399 lb) and the ideal weight of female dogs is described to be 32\u201335 kilograms (71\u201377 lb)." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5ed" }, "breed": "Dogue Brasileiro", "origin": "Brazil", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Dogo", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Doguebrasileiro.jpg/220px-Doguebrasileiro.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e8a" }, "breed": "Dogue Brasileiro", "contenido": "The Dogue Brasileiro is a mastiff-type working dog breed originating in Brazil.

However, it has the official Brazilian recognition by the Brazilian Confederation of Cynophilia (CBKC) where it belongs to the Group  11 - Breeds not recognized by the FCI.,The original developer of the breed was a Bull Terrier breeder named Pedro Pessoa Ribeiro Dantas from Caxias do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul. In 1978, his neighbor asked him to mate one of his Bull Terrier males with the neighbor's female Boxer. Pedro took one of the female puppies from this mating, and named her Tigresa after the brindle markings on her coat. As Tigresa grew, she turned out to be a very pleasant and promising individual: she was extremely affectionate, obedient, quick-to-learn, physically balanced, strong, and vigorous. Moreover, she lacked the extreme characteristics typical to the modern Bull Terrier, being much more functional and agile. She was also physically stronger than both an average Bull Terrier and an average Boxer. At the same time she was an excellent guard and very tolerant towards Pedro's Bull Terriers: when they tried to provoke her, she rather eluded the attacks by her better physical agility and balance than by using aggression.,After noticing the great qualities of Tigresa, Pedro started to gather information from other people who had purchased a puppy from the same litter. The response was that the dogs had become physically vigorous and excellent guards, at the same time being gentle and affectionate towards their families. Therefore, another mating between a different Bull Terrier and a Boxer. Because the results turned out to be as positive as in the first litter, a new breeding line was decided to be established and was originally named Bull Boxer (which should not be confused with the English designer breed with the same name based on a Staffordshire Bull Terrier x Boxer cross).,After the first generation of Bull Terrier x Boxer crosses consisting of 80 individuals, Pedro continued by occasional matings between these crosses. The qualities and health of the new puppies were followed during their growth. It was noticed that a vast majority of them possessed the following characteristics:,Extremely efficient guardian,Balanced temper and extremely attached to his family,Physically balanced and powerful, with the extreme pain tolerance of the Bull Terrier,Longevity, lifespan being approximately 13 yearsAlthough the results were promising, Pedro was not yet sure if the same results could also be achieved by using other similar kinds of breeds. Therefore, he crossed several Bull Boxers with the American Staffordshire Terrier and noticed that at least in the first generation, the characteristics remained the same. However, no more American Staffordshire Terrier crosses were made in the following generations and soon the studbook was closed in order to continue the breeding solely by using already existing Bull Boxers.,The Brazilian Bull Boxer Club was founded in 1986 and its president is Pedro Ribeiro Dantas himself. The breed was officially accepted by the CBKC in 1999 and the today's version of the breed standard was published in 2007. Nowadays there are 2000 pure-bred dogs in the official registry of the Bull Boxer Club - however, the number also includes many dogs that have already died. There are breeders in many different states of Brazil and the breed has grown popularity since the 1990s. Although the Dogue Brasileiro is not recognized by the FCI, it does not bother Brazilian breeders and fanciers of the breed: actually, the president of the Bull Boxer Club has stated that the FCI's current principles do not meet with the breeding philosophy of the Dogue Brasileiro." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5f0" }, "breed": "East Siberian Laika", "origin": "Russia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Siberian_Laika", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/East_Siberian_Laika.jpg/220px-East_Siberian_Laika.jpg", "behavior": [], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5e93" }, "breed": "East Siberian Laika", "contenido": "The East Siberian Laika (Vostotchno-Sibirskaia Laika) is a Russian breed of dog of spitz type, a hunting dog originating in parts of Siberia east of the Yenisei River.,Males are 55 to 66 centimetres (22 to 26 in), while females are on the smaller side at 51 to 60 centimetres (20 to 24 in).,Black and tan, with light patches (called karamis), grizzle, patched, ticked, white, grey, black, red and brown of all shades.

It is sometimes called the Irish Glen of Imaal Terrier or the Wicklow Terrier, and the name of the breed is often shortened by fanciers to just Glen.,The breed originates in, and is named for, the Glen of Imaal in County Wicklow, Ireland. It was recognised first by the Irish Kennel Club in 1934 and most recently by the American Kennel Club in 2004. The Canadian Kennel Club voted to fully recognize Glens in 2017 after the breed spent years on the Miscellaneous list; approval by Agriculture Canada is pending.,Reportedly, the Glen's history began during the reign of Elizabeth I, who hired French and Hessian mercenaries to put down a rebellion in Ireland. After the conflict, many of these soldiers settled in the Wicklow area. They brought with them their low-slung hounds, which they bred with the local terrier stock, eventually developing a distinctive breed that became known as the Glen of Imaal Terrier.Glens were originally used for eradicating other animals such as rat, fox, badger, and otter, and also as a general-purpose farm dog for herding and family companionship. Unlike many other terriers, they are \"strong dogs\" rather than \"sounders\"\u2014they were bred to work mute to ground, going silently into dens after their quarry rather than barking at it to alert their handlers. In hunting trials, which used to be required by many kennel clubs for championships, Glens were disqualified if they sounded at the quarry. For this reason, today they are among the quietest terriers.,According to Irish lore, Glen of Imaal Terriers were also used as turnspit dogs to turn meat over fires for cooking. Evidence for this is scarce, and engravings of such dogs from the 19th century do not bear much resemblance to today's Glen. It is, however, repeated in many descriptions of the breed and often used in color commentary by dog show announcers.The breed almost died out before being revived in the early twentieth century by breeders in its homeland. Paddy Brennan Tinahely Co Wicklow, and Willie Kane Tipperary are recognised as two breeders that revived the breed. Today, the Glen of Imaal Terrier is still one of the rarest breeds of dog (in the US, living registered animals number in the hundreds) and the least-known Irish terrier breed. It is considered a vulnerable native breed by the UK's Kennel Club, which tracks breeds in which fewer than 300 puppies are registered each year.[1],A \"big dog on short legs,\" the Glen of Imaal Terrier is an achondroplastic dwarf breed. It is more substantial than might be expected from photographs; a typical adult Glen weighs about 36 pounds and stands 14\" tall at the withers. The AKC breed standard specifies a height of 12\" to 14\" and a weight of \"approximately\" 35 pounds for males and \"somewhat less\" for females, with a length-to-height ratio of 5:3. Many champion Glens are larger than breed standard, with some individuals exceeding 40 or even 45 pounds. With three growth stages, a Glen can take up to four years to reach full maturity.,Glens have a large head, with rose or half-prick ears; short, bowed legs; and a straight topline that rises slightly toward the tail. The shoulders, chest, and hips are sturdy and muscular (the AKC breed standard specifies an impression of \"maximum substance for size\") and the front feet are turned out. The breed is considered unrefined, with antique features that were common in early terriers but which have since fallen out of favor with fanciers and breeders.,On their back, Glens have a unique double coat that is wiry with a soft undercoat. The head, sides, and legs have only the softer coat, which typically develops a degree of waviness. The color of the coat may be wheaten or blue (the latter usually with brindling), with both wheaten and blue encompassing a range of shades. Other colorings do occasionally occur in Glens (including a mixture of wheaten and blue referred to as \"grizzle\" and a \"blue and tan\" that is blue on top with wheaten furnishings) but these rare variations, while not disqualifications, are not favored by fanciers.  ,Wheaten Glen of Imaal puppies often have black highlights in their fur, and when young may show a \"dorsal stripe\" of darker fur down the middle of their backs, but this usually does not appear in their adult coat.,The Glen of Imaal terrier does not molt or shed much, and needs to be brushed or combed every week or two to keep the soft coat in good condition and free of matting. It is also typical to strip excess hair from the hard coat two to four times per year; this \"dead\" hair pulls out easily and painlessly with the proper tools.,Although some extra grooming is needed for showing (for example, the light-colored soft undercoat is often \"carded\" from the back to enhance the color of the darker wiry coat), the Glen is intended to have a \"rough and ready\" appearance, and show grooming requires less effort than in many other breeds. Glens should look tidy but natural, never manicured or clipped, in the conformation ring.,Historically, the breed's tail was typically docked to a length just sufficient to serve as a handhold for pulling the dog out of a badger hole. Docking is still standard in the United States, though some breeders have stopped doing it, and an intact tail is not a fault in AKC conformation showing. Many countries, however, ban docking for showing completely. Ireland has banned showing of dogs whose tails were docked on or after March 6, 2014 (the procedure is also itself illegal with very limited exceptions). In the UK, working terriers can still be shown with docked tails, but dogs kept as pets cannot." }] }, { "_id": { "$oid": "625f2900fe6aeb351381c5f8" }, "breed": "Greater Swiss Mountain Dog", "origin": "Switzerland", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Swiss_Mountain_Dog", "img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Greater_Swiss_Mountain_Dog_2018.jpg/220px-Greater_Swiss_Mountain_Dog_2018.jpg", "behavior": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "625f2ba9fe6aeb351381c73e" }, "image_link": "https://api-ninjas.com/images/dogs/greater_swiss_mountain_dog.jpg", "good_with_children": 5, "good_with_other_dogs": 3, "shedding": 3, "grooming": 2, "drooling": 3, "coat_length": 1, "good_with_strangers": 5, "playfulness": 4, "protectiveness": 4, "trainability": 4, "energy": 4, "barking": 3, "min_life_expectancy": 8, "max_life_expectancy": 11, "max_height_male": 28.5, "max_height_female": 28.5, "max_weight_male": 140, "max_weight_female": 110, "min_height_male": 25.5, "min_height_female": 25.5, "min_weight_male": 115, "min_weight_female": 85, "breed": "Greater Swiss Mountain Dog" }], "Description": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "626829de7103fd0096bd5ec6" }, "breed": "Greater Swiss Mountain Dog", "contenido": "The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog (German: Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund or French: Grand Bouvier Suisse) is a dog breed which was developed in the Swiss Alps. The name Sennenhund refers to people called Senn or Senner, dairymen and herders in the Swiss Alps. Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are almost certainly the result of indigenous dogs mating with large mastiff-type dogs brought to Switzerland by foreign settlers. At one time, the breed was believed to have been among the most popular in Switzerland. It was assumed to have almost died out by the late 19th century, since its work was being done by other breeds or machines, but was rediscovered in the early 1900s.The breed is large and heavy-boned with great physical strength, but is still agile enough to perform the all-purpose farm duties it was originally used for. Its breed standard calls for a black, white, and rust colored coat.,The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is sociable, active, calm, and dignified, and loves being part of the family. It is relatively healthy for its size and tends to have far fewer problems than more popular breeds in its size range. Among the four Sennenhunde, or Swiss mountain dogs, this breed is considered the oldest, and is also the largest.,The origin of the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is not known. Beginning in 1515, the remote valleys of Switzerland were more or less isolated from world history for three centuries. Specific dog breeds were created by inbreeding, and puppies were given to neighbors and family members.There are several theories regarding the origin of the four Sennenhund breeds. The most popular theory states the dogs are descended from the Molossus, a large mastiff-type dog, which accompanied the Roman Legions on their invasion of the Alps more than 2,000 years ago.A second theory is that in 1100 BC, the Phoenicians brought a large dog breed with them to settlements in Spain. These dogs later migrated eastward and influenced the development of the Spanish Mastiff, Great Pyrenees, Dogue de Bordeaux, and Sennenhund breeds.A third possibility is that a large dog breed was indigenous to central Europe during the Neolithic Period, when humans grew wild and domestic crops and used domesticated animals. Whether or not a domesticated large breed existed in the Alpine area when the Romans invaded, Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are almost certainly the result of the mating of native farm dogs with large Mastiff-type dogs brought to Switzerland by foreign settlers. The early ancestors of the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog were used by farmers, herdsmen and merchants in central Europe. The breed was bred as a draught dog to pull heavy carts, to guard and move dairy cattle, and as a watchdog and family companion.,Selective breeding was based on a dog's ability to perform a particular function, such as pulling loads or guarding. The Swiss farmer needed a strong, multi-purpose dog capable of contributing to daily life on the farm. Large, sturdy and confident, the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is a draft and drover breed that is robust and agile enough to perform farm work in very mountainous regions. The breed was also used as a butcher's dog, having been \"popular with butchers, cattle dealers, manual workers and farmers, who used them as guard dogs, droving or draught dogs and bred them as such.\" Its popularity as a draft dog led to the nickname \"the poor man's horse\".

The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.,It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion dog, and according to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations in 2013.,During the 1890s, attempts were being made to standardise dog breeds. Dogs were being bred to preserve traits that assisted in their job of herding sheep and protecting their flocks from predators. In Germany this was practised within local communities, where shepherds selected and bred dogs. It was recognised that the breed had the necessary skills for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen senses of smell. The results were dogs that were able to do such things, but that differed significantly, both in appearance and ability, from one locality to another.To combat these differences, the Phylax Society was formed in 1891 with the intention of creating standardised development plans for native dog breeds in Germany. The society disbanded after only three years due to ongoing internal conflicts regarding the traits in dogs that the society should promote; some members believed dogs should be bred solely for working purposes, while others believed dogs should be bred also for appearance. While unsuccessful in their goal, the Phylax Society had inspired people to pursue standardising dog breeds independently.,With the rise of large, industrialised cities in Germany, the predator population began to decline, rendering sheepdogs unnecessary. At the same time, the awareness of sheepdogs as a versatile, intelligent class of canine began to rise. Max von Stephanitz, an ex-cavalry captain and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was an ex-member of the Phylax Society who firmly believed dogs should be bred for working. He admired the intelligence, strength and ability of Germany's native sheepdogs, but could not find any one single breed that satisfied him as the perfect working dog.In 1899, von Stephanitz was attending a dog show when he was shown a dog named Hektor Linksrhein. Hektor was the product of few generations of selective breeding and completely fulfilled what von Stephanitz believed a working dog should be. He was pleased with the strength of the dog and was so taken by the animal's intelligence, loyalty, and beauty, that he purchased him immediately. After purchasing the dog he changed his name to Horand von Grafrath and von Stephanitz founded the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde (Society for German Shepherd Dogs). Horand was declared to be the first German Shepherd Dog, and was the first dog added to the society's breed register. In just a few decades of the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde's establishment, the breed became one of the world's most popular and numerous, a position it has maintained to this day. By 1923, the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde claimed 50,000 dues-paying members in more than 500 branches in Germany alone.Horand became the center-point of the breeding programs and was bred with dogs belonging to other society members that displayed desirable traits and with dogs from Thuringia, Franconia, and W\u00fcrttemberg. Fathering many pups, Horand's most prolific was Hektor von Schwaben. Hektor was inbred with another of Horand's offspring and produced Heinz von Starkenburg, Beowulf, and Pilot, who later sired a total of 84 pups, mostly through being inbred with Hektor's other offspring. This inbreeding was deemed necessary in order to fix the traits being sought in the breed. Beowulf's progeny also were inbred and it is from these pups that all German shepherds draw a genetic link. It is believed the society accomplished its goal mostly due to von Stephanitz's strong, uncompromising leadership and he is therefore credited with being the creator of the German Shepherd Dog.During the first half of the twentieth century, the breed came to be strongly identified with Imperial and Nazi Germany, because of its association with purity and militarism. German shepherds were coveted as \"germanische Urhunde\", being close to the wolf, and became very fashionable during the Nazi era. Adolf Hitler acquired a German Shepherd named \"Prinz\" in 1921, during his years of poverty, but he had been forced to lodge the dog elsewhere. However, she managed to escape and return to him. Hitler, who adored the loyalty and obedience of the dog, thereafter developed a great liking for the breed. Hitler kept several more of the breed, including Blondi, who was among several dogs in the 'F\u00fchrerbunker' during the Battle of Berlin at the end of the Second World War. Dogs played a role in Nazi propaganda by portraying Hitler as an animal lover. Preparing for his suicide, Hitler ordered Dr. Werner Haase to test a cyanide capsule on Blondi, and the dog died as a result. Erna Flegel, a nurse who worked at the emergency casualty station in the Reich Chancellery stated in 2005 that Blondi's death had affected the people in the bunker more than Eva Braun's suicide. German Shepherds were also used widely as guard dogs at Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust.When the German Shepherd was introduced to the United States it was initially a popular dog. But as the dogs' popularity grew, it became associated as a dangerous breed owned by gangsters and bootleggers. The reputation of the German shepherds as a dangerous breed had grown to such an extent that it was briefly banned to import them in Australia in 1929. Potential legislation was even considered to require that all German shepherds in South Australia be sterilised.,The breed was named Deutscher Sch\u00e4ferhund, by von Stephanitz, literally translating to \"German Shepherd Dog\".  At the time, all other herding dogs in Germany were referred to by this name; they thus became known as Altdeutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde, or Old German herding dogs.,The direct translation of the name was adopted for use in the stud-book; however, at the end of the First World War, it was believed that the inclusion of the word \"German\" would harm the breed's popularity, due to the anti-German sentiment of the era. The breed was officially renamed by the UK Kennel Club to \"Alsatian Wolf Dog\", after the French region of Alsace bordering Germany.Eventually, the appendage \"wolf dog\" was dropped, after numerous campaigns by breeders who were worried that becoming known as a wolf-dog hybrid would affect the breed's popularity and legality. The name Alsatian remained for five decades, until 1977, when successful campaigns by dog enthusiasts pressured the British kennel clubs to allow the breed to be registered again as German Shepherds. The word \"Alsatian\" once appeared in parentheses as part of the formal breed name of the American Kennel Club and was removed in 2010.,The German Shepherd Dog, also known as the Alsatian, is a German breed of working dog of medium to large size.

In just a few decades of the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde's establishment, the breed became one of the world's most popular and numerous, a position it has maintained to this day. By 1923, the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde claimed 50,000 dues-paying members in more than 500 branches in Germany alone.Horand became the center-point of the breeding programs and was bred with dogs belonging to other society members that displayed desirable traits and with dogs from Thuringia, Franconia, and W\u00fcrttemberg. Fathering many pups, Horand's most prolific was Hektor von Schwaben. Hektor was inbred with another of Horand's offspring and produced Heinz von Starkenburg, Beowulf, and Pilot, who later sired a total of 84 pups, mostly through being inbred with Hektor's other offspring. This inbreeding was deemed necessary in order to fix the traits being sought in the breed. Beowulf's progeny also were inbred and it is from these pups that all German shepherds draw a genetic link. It is believed the society accomplished its goal mostly due to von Stephanitz's strong, uncompromising leadership and he is therefore credited with being the creator of the German Shepherd Dog.During the first half of the twentieth century, the breed came to be strongly identified with Imperial and Nazi Germany, because of its association with purity and militarism. German shepherds were coveted as \"germanische Urhunde\", being close to the wolf, and became very fashionable during the Nazi era. Adolf Hitler acquired a German Shepherd named \"Prinz\" in 1921, during his years of poverty, but he had been forced to lodge the dog elsewhere. However, she managed to escape and return to him. Hitler, who adored the loyalty and obedience of the dog, thereafter developed a great liking for the breed. Hitler kept several more of the breed, including Blondi, who was among several dogs in the 'F\u00fchrerbunker' during the Battle of Berlin at the end of the Second World War. Dogs played a role in Nazi propaganda by portraying Hitler as an animal lover. Preparing for his suicide, Hitler ordered Dr. Werner Haase to test a cyanide capsule on Blondi, and the dog died as a result. Erna Flegel, a nurse who worked at the emergency casualty station in the Reich Chancellery stated in 2005 that Blondi's death had affected the people in the bunker more than Eva Braun's suicide. German Shepherds were also used widely as guard dogs at Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust.When the German Shepherd was introduced to the United States it was initially a popular dog. But as the dogs' popularity grew, it became associated as a dangerous breed owned by gangsters and bootleggers. The reputation of the German shepherds as a dangerous breed had grown to such an extent that it was briefly banned to import them in Australia in 1929. Potential legislation was even considered to require that all German shepherds in South Australia be sterilised.,The breed was named Deutscher Sch\u00e4ferhund, by von Stephanitz, literally translating to \"German Shepherd Dog\".  At the time, all other herding dogs in Germany were referred to by this name; they thus became known as Altdeutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde, or Old German herding dogs.,The direct translation of the name was adopted for use in the stud-book; however, at the end of the First World War, it was believed that the inclusion of the word \"German\" would harm the breed's popularity, due to the anti-German sentiment of the era. The breed was officially renamed by the UK Kennel Club to \"Alsatian Wolf Dog\", after the French region of Alsace bordering Germany.Eventually, the appendage \"wolf dog\" was dropped, after numerous campaigns by breeders who were worried that becoming known as a wolf-dog hybrid would affect the breed's popularity and legality. The name Alsatian remained for five decades, until 1977, when successful campaigns by dog enthusiasts pressured the British kennel clubs to allow the breed to be registered again as German Shepherds. The word \"Alsatian\" once appeared in parentheses as part of the formal breed name of the American Kennel Club and was removed in 2010.,The German Shepherd Dog, also known as the Alsatian, is a German breed of working dog of medium to large size. The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.,It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion dog, and according to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations in 2013.,During the 1890s, attempts were being made to standardise dog breeds. Dogs were being bred to preserve traits that assisted in their job of herding sheep and protecting their flocks from predators. In Germany this was practised within local communities, where shepherds selected and bred dogs. It was recognised that the breed had the necessary skills for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen senses of smell. The results were dogs that were able to do such things, but that differed significantly, both in appearance and ability, from one locality to another.To combat these differences, the Phylax Society was formed in 1891 with the intention of creating standardised development plans for native dog breeds in Germany. The society disbanded after only three years due to ongoing internal conflicts regarding the traits in dogs that the society should promote; some members believed dogs should be bred solely for working purposes, while others believed dogs should be bred also for appearance. While unsuccessful in their goal, the Phylax Society had inspired people to pursue standardising dog breeds independently.,With the rise of large, industrialised cities in Germany, the predator population began to decline, rendering sheepdogs unnecessary. At the same time, the awareness of sheepdogs as a versatile, intelligent class of canine began to rise. Max von Stephanitz, an ex-cavalry captain and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was an ex-member of the Phylax Society who firmly believed dogs should be bred for working. He admired the intelligence, strength and ability of Germany's native sheepdogs, but could not find any one single breed that satisfied him as the perfect working dog.In 1899, von Stephanitz was attending a dog show when he was shown a dog named Hektor Linksrhein. Hektor was the product of few generations of selective breeding and completely fulfilled what von Stephanitz believed a working dog should be. He was pleased with the strength of the dog and was so taken by the animal's intelligence, loyalty, and beauty, that he purchased him immediately. After purchasing the dog he changed his name to Horand von Grafrath and von Stephanitz founded the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde (Society for German Shepherd Dogs).
